2
00:00:15,017 --> 00:00:18,025
They want us to believe that Vought
superheroes are the only answer.

3
00:00:18,026 --> 00:00:19,561
What else are they lying to us about?

4
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:21,063
A-Train, you're out.

5
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:22,648
- Out of what?
- Out of the Seven.

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,275
I ended the relationship when I met you.

7
00:00:25,276 --> 00:00:27,987
Stop fucking lying to me.

8
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,196
And you love her?

9
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:34,952
We shouldn't feel so calm or
safe. So, what are we gonna do?

10
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:37,288
Cross our fingers that
Homelander's gonna save us?

11
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:38,539
I'm the face of the Seven.

12
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:39,707
I'm just trying to help.

13
00:00:39,749 --> 00:00:41,309
Ain't you supposed to be a hero?

14
00:00:41,321 --> 00:00:42,322
I am a hero.

15
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:43,419
That's Liberty.

16
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,339
William Butcher?

17
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:48,583
I found Becca.

18
00:00:48,624 --> 00:00:50,592
I'm gonna get you the fuck out of here.

19
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:52,219
- I'm not leaving.
- Becca, you and me...

20
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:53,888
- we could disappear.
- I have a son!

21
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,139
He's a fucking Supe freak.

22
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,995
Ruby!

23
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:28,379
Ruby!

24
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,179
Here! I'm here!

25
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:47,650
Looks like you saved me, Red.

26
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,360
No, you saved us.

27
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:52,029
If you hadn't broken into
that DHS mainframe...

28
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:55,199
True. I am a hell of a hacker...

29
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:56,951
but I'm no hero.

30
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,662
You are a hero in lots of ways.

31
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,248
What do you mean?

32
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,378
You're not afraid to live your life.

33
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:10,047
To be who you really are.

34
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:12,216
Me, I'm...

35
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:16,178
I'm afraid to... to show
the world who I am.

36
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,888
Yeah?

37
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,682
So who are you, Maeve?

38
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:22,226
I'm a lot like you.

39
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:26,564
I'm gay.

40
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,152
We have to keep moving.

41
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,447
And... cut!

42
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,949
Brilliant.

43
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:39,243
Yes, that was absolutely brilliant.

44
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:40,870
Gang, let's check that.

45
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:44,331
And, ladies and gents,
it is a wrap for today!

46
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:45,749
Good job, people.

47
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,791
That was so great.

48
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,753
Let's hit it hard in the
a.m., people, thank you.

49
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:52,298
That's a wrap, people!

50
00:02:53,424 --> 00:02:54,824
Hey, Marty, play that back, please.

51
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,221
- You enjoying this?
- Yeah.

52
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:02,808
This new Joss rewrite really sings, huh?

53
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:06,020
When are you going to stop torturing me?

54
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:08,147
Don't know what you're talking about.

55
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:14,445
If I promise to never see her again,

56
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,780
will you stop?

57
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:20,326
But, Maeve, you're in love.

58
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,161
It's beautiful.

59
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,329
Elena's good for you,

60
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,010
and I'm not gonna let
you throw that away.

61
00:03:25,011 --> 00:03:27,875
Not now, not ever.

62
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:29,585
I mean, that would be cruel.

63
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:30,827
- Can I have a word?
- Come on.

64
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,297
- Sir, please?
- Oh, look at this.

65
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:37,092
Look at these strong
female lesbians. Hmm?

66
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,510
I'm inspired.

67
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:39,637
- You inspired?
- Ooh, yeah.

68
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:40,930
Girls get it on.

69
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,097
Done. Girls get it done.

70
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,699
- They sure do, Ashley.
- In-in private.

71
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,828
Sir, please. It's urgent.

72
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,696
Ooh...

73
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:03,202
Ugh.

74
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,496
Terrific!

75
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,216
Oh.

76
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,973
Oh.

77
00:04:26,776 --> 00:04:28,035
So, what, they're all starving

78
00:04:28,077 --> 00:04:29,811
but one of them's got
a fucking cell phone?

79
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:30,980
Uh, you know,

80
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,661
I really wish you had
cleared this with me

81
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,984
- before you went over there.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

82
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,986
I don't have to clear
shit with you, Ashley.

83
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,489
I saw a chance for an
easy win, and I took it.

84
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,572
- How many views?
- Well, they posted last night,

85
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:42,866
we scrubbed it 17 minutes later.

86
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,243
But that's forever,

87
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,996
and there's been some-some blowback.

88
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,039
Blowback?

89
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,043
All right, fine, fine, fine.

90
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:55,587
So, what, I-I'm down a-a point?

91
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,006
Point and a half? Two?

92
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,008
No, nine and a half.

93
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,218
Nine and a half?

94
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,763
Nine... nine and a half?

95
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,938
Homelander kills!

96
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,899
What, th-they're fucking protesting...

97
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,484
- Homelander kills!
- ...me?

98
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:18,686
Oh, my God, th-they're pro...

99
00:05:18,687 --> 00:05:19,903
they're protesting me?

100
00:05:19,905 --> 00:05:21,505
They've been at the Tower all afternoon.

101
00:05:21,506 --> 00:05:23,741
Why didn't you fucking say something?

102
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,076
Goddamn it.

103
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,828
Don't these fucking ingrates realize

104
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,705
I killed that asshole for them.

105
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:32,028
What do they think "Saving
America" fucking means, anyway?

106
00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:34,543
Well, PR is drafting a
response as we speak.

107
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,086
Acknowledgment, apology, action.

108
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:37,880
No, no, no, no. Apology?

109
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,256
No.

110
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:40,799
You schedule a press conference,

111
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,676
and-and I'll clean it up myself.

112
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:45,971
Uh, well, Mr. Edgar...

113
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:49,349
and Legal would like
your official position

114
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:52,019
to be "no comment" at this time.

115
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:54,521
Please, no press

116
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:57,191
until the crisis team has
an actionable strategy.

117
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,234
Okay?

118
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,613
Bad day?

119
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,867
Hey, I'm with you.

120
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:09,036
Fuck these maxi
pad-wearing ingrate hicks,

121
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:10,718
but, you know, there's
a way to handle it.

122
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:13,248
I do not need your fucking help.

123
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,502
Sure. You seem to be
doing so well on your own.

124
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:20,047
Well, I'm here when you want me.

125
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:25,088
Hello, hello. Hughie?

126
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,715
Hey, hey. Hi, hi.

127
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:29,176
Sorry, thought, uh, I was
getting your voice mail.

128
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:31,345
That why you called five times?

129
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,013
No, I just thought you should know

130
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:35,974
Liberty, that Supe that
Raynor was looking into,

131
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,726
turns out it's Stormfront.

132
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:39,928
Vought changed her name,
they've been moving her around

133
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:41,438
like a fucking Catholic priest.

134
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,232
- Right.
- Um...

135
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,775
she probably murdered Raynor.

136
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,027
Annie's trying to figure out why, but...

137
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:48,528
you know, who the fuck knows.

138
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,030
Well...

139
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:51,740
as long as Starlight's on the job,

140
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:53,075
we're sorted then, yeah?

141
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:57,496
I'm not... I'm not mad, you know.

142
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,289
What you mean?

143
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:02,209
I-I just want you to know that, um...

144
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:05,128
yes, you are leaving us holding
the bag on this shitshow,

145
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,690
but I want you to know that I-I get it.

146
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:08,382
It's, uh, Becca.

147
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,092
I'd do the same thing.

148
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,385
I'm not mad.

149
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,222
Well...

150
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:16,640
wouldn't matter if you were.

151
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:18,642
Uh, how is she?

152
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:20,644
Lovelier than the day I met her.

153
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,982
Where are you?

154
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,525
Heading off grid.

155
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,818
Argentina, maybe.

156
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,278
Early retirement.

157
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,613
Butcher?

158
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,699
Yeah, what?

159
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,744
You could've said goodbye.

160
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:43,292
I know we've been through
some shit together.

161
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:49,715
You were...

162
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:53,218
you were always like
my canary, I suppose.

163
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,721
Thank you.

164
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,140
- Goodbye, Hughie.
- Your canary...

165
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,475
Hello?

166
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,738
On your feet, soldier.

167
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,411
Take me home to Lallybroch.

168
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:20,662
What are you watching?

169
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,958
A show called Eat My Dick.

170
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,169
Okay.

171
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,338
Have you seen Frenchie or Kimiko?

172
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:32,007
No. No, not... for a while. Why?

173
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:33,884
Fuck.

174
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:35,845
Uh, listen, I just got off
the phone with Butcher

175
00:10:35,846 --> 00:10:37,346
and I think something might be wrong.

176
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,973
Like really, really wrong.

177
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:42,059
What would make you think that?

178
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,646
He was nice and...

179
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,692
...called me his canary?

180
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,783
Tell me everything he said.

181
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:13,840
Agent Pearson, sir.

182
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,098
Oh, you're a sight for sore eyes.

183
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,808
Agent Cruz, I thought we'd lost you.

184
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,810
I got by with a little
help from a friend.

185
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,186
Huh, so?

186
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:28,021
Good news or bad?

187
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:32,984
Yeah, I'd say that's good news.

188
00:11:32,986 --> 00:11:34,586
And now the CG mutants approach.

189
00:11:34,587 --> 00:11:36,363
And there's the bad news.

190
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:38,407
There's no way we can restore the grid

191
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,575
if we don't get that
flash drive to the Tower.

192
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,417
But how are you gonna
get through all of them?

193
00:11:42,418 --> 00:11:43,752
Don't worry.

194
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:48,125
Girls get it done.

195
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,835
And cut on rehearsal. No one move.

196
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,377
- No one move. No one move.
- Cut on rehearsal!

197
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,878
- Starlight. I'm not touching.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

198
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,213
- But can you just take a step?
- Mm-hmm.

199
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,298
Yeah, so keep going closer.

200
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,820
Can you mark her closer to Stormfront?

201
00:11:56,821 --> 00:11:57,926
Let's mark her, please.

202
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,177
And let's just pretend...

203
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,278
like you like her, okay?

204
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,473
Okay, if I have to.

205
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:04,933
Okay. Okay, good stuff.

206
00:12:04,935 --> 00:12:06,535
Let's try one for that. All right, good.

207
00:12:06,536 --> 00:12:08,270
We should've shot that.

208
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,855
I mean, clearly you like me.

209
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,899
You've been eye-fucking me
like a lovesick stangirl all day.

210
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,943
Why is that?

211
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:17,446
I don't know. I think
that you're a good actor.

212
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:20,657
And I just, I feel like a
friggin' fembot up there.

213
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:23,618
You know...

214
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,455
Everybody, can we
please stand by to roll.

215
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:27,873
Let's try to make our day.

216
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,083
- How about that? Okay.
- Thank you.

217
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,460
♪ Extra, Extra. ♪

218
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,212
And turning now to superhero news,

219
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,174
former Seven member the Deep
surprised everybody last week

220
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,926
when he married Cassandra Schwartz,

221
00:12:39,945 --> 00:12:41,385
an anthropology professor at Vassar,

222
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,096
in an intimate ceremony.

223
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:46,183
- Now, the couple has asked...
- Banana saltwater taffy.

224
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,267
God bless.

225
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,852
Ron can't live without it.

226
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,317
Billy?

227
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,527
- Hello, Judy.
- Who's this?

228
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,154
He's my nephew.

229
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,411
For Christ's sake, Billy,
you got to ring your mum.

230
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,497
Where's my boy?

231
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,790
Your mum and dad are
flying over, you know.

232
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:13,752
Your mum's worried to death about you.

233
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,253
No.

234
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,713
You tell 'em no.

235
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:19,382
It'd be a waste of a
perfectly good plane ticket.

236
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,551
Your father's quite ill.

237
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:23,637
The cancer's spreading fast.

238
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,347
Yeah, well, not fast enough.

239
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:28,517
I ain't seeing 'em. Now, where's me boy?

240
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,565
Oi, Terror.

241
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,402
You little rascal, eh?

242
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:40,684
Look at you, you little fucker.

243
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,489
You haven't changed a day.

244
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:45,575
How's about you and me go
for a little stroll then, eh?

245
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:47,577
Yeah?

246
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,621
Come on.

247
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:09,099
So this is what it all comes to, eh?

248
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:14,312
Metamucil and ringing our dicks
out for a few drops of piss.

249
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:21,111
I used to think that you, me and
Becca would grow old together.

250
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,405
Bloody stupid.

251
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,532
Turns out she don't...

252
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:34,624
What the fuck was any of it for?

253
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,550
Yes.

254
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:45,176
There he is, there's my guy.

255
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,220
Looking spectacular, as always.

256
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:48,471
- How we doing?
- Good.

257
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:49,831
- Feel good?
- Yeah. Uh...

258
00:14:49,873 --> 00:14:51,265
Are you ready, huh?
You ready for this...

259
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:52,517
this big fucking scene today?

260
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,959
Yeah, well, that's-that's basically

261
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:55,395
what I wanted to talk to you about.

262
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:57,597
- Great. Yeah.
- 'Cause I did a little bit of a rewrite

263
00:14:57,598 --> 00:14:59,766
and I want you to take a look.

264
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:01,557
Wow.

265
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:05,739
What a... lot of work.

266
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,115
Yeah, I...

267
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:10,493
I just felt like the dialogue
was a little... off.

268
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,245
You know, A-Train...

269
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:14,623
- would never say any of this shit.
- Right.

270
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,224
And you definitely just don't need that

271
00:15:16,225 --> 00:15:19,419
giant expo dump at the end.

272
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:22,839
Your... big farewell speech?

273
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:28,178
Honestly, I think it's better if
we just leave it open-ended.

274
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,471
- Okay.
- You know what I mean?

275
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,556
Uh, where we can just play it in looks

276
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,433
and just not a whole bunch of words.

277
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,393
- Right.
- Maybe make it more of a question.

278
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,395
Like, is A-Train really
leaving the Seven?

279
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,105
- Yeah.
- We don't know.

280
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:42,025
- We don't know.
- We don't know.

281
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,568
Yeah.

282
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,170
Yeah, I think we're just gonna go ahead

283
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:46,705
and do the scene as scripted.

284
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:48,405
But thank you for putting
all this thought into it,

285
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:49,966
right, it shows you got a lot of heart.

286
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:51,826
Take that heart, put it in the scene.

287
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,745
All right, good stuff.

288
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,830
I'm not doing it.

289
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,417
I'm not doing this shitty scene.

290
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,712
Well...

291
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:07,175
That is way above my pay grade.

292
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,137
Bring that up with Ashley.

293
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,723
Right? Right.

294
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,308
Ooh, by the way.

295
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,950
I got the crew a Vietnamese crêpe truck.

296
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,561
They make a gluten-free banh xeo.

297
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:21,106
It is... fantastic.

298
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,424
You're going to be great, baby.

299
00:16:22,465 --> 00:16:23,785
- Where are we going?
- Oh,

300
00:16:23,786 --> 00:16:25,063
we need to see you in Wardrobe.

301
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:27,737
Deep.

302
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,699
You look so happy. I
hardly recognize you.

303
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,900
Katie, I'm in love, you know,

304
00:16:31,901 --> 00:16:33,493
to an extraordinary woman

305
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,495
I'm now blessed to call my wife.

306
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:38,164
Ah, that-that's really nice.

307
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:41,376
Well, let's address the
elephant in the room.

308
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:42,544
Shall we?

309
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,629
Well, you know, I'm-I'm glad you asked,

310
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,339
because, uh, yeah, you know,

311
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:50,093
Kevin here has had
some issues in the past.

312
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:51,636
But people grow.

313
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:55,140
And if you could see the
letters that he writes me.

314
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,350
I mean, you would know
what a beautiful soul he has.

315
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:58,393
Oh, thank you.

316
00:16:58,435 --> 00:16:59,602
Well, she's only saying that

317
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,244
'cause I make her
breakfast in bed, so...

318
00:17:01,285 --> 00:17:02,685
- Oh, stop.
- French toast.

319
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:09,988
So, you are both members of
the Church of the Collective.

320
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,323
- Mm-hmm.
- It's not realistic.

321
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,034
Alexander Hamilton
wasn't no Puerto Rican.

322
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,911
That's the point.

323
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,873
It's a metaphor for the
immigrant experience in America.

324
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,708
But he was a white guy.

325
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,543
Ah.

326
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:26,546
You know what's really good?

327
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:28,256
Dear Evan Hansen.

328
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:29,799
Can we help you?

329
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:38,433
She's just a girl.

330
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:40,643
Show her a picture of
kittens or some shit.

331
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,064
How 'bout I show her
my motherfuckin' dick?

332
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:53,814
Bitch ain't right in the head.

333
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:56,493
Fuck!

334
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:00,288
Holy shit!

335
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:23,853
Merde.

336
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,044
Oi, Billy.

337
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:50,463
You should've told me you
were bringing company.

338
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:53,091
Oi, who's this one remind you of?

339
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,261
Isn't he the spitting of Lenny?

340
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,890
No.

341
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:03,017
Thought you were retiring.

342
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,770
Argentina, right?

343
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,772
I am.

344
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:11,776
What are you doing here?

345
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,778
Well, Hughie heard a
dog toy on the phone.

346
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,490
And I know you keep
Terror at your aunt's, so...

347
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:18,825
Brilliant as ever.

348
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,118
Time to go.

349
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,911
Come help us with Stormfront.

350
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:23,872
Came all this way for that, did you?

351
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,457
No, we... we came 'cause we're worried.

352
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,585
Your cunt sense tingling, is it?

353
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:32,005
Well, don't you worry... I'm sorted.

354
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:33,756
Where's Becca, man?

355
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,216
Becca?

356
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:37,886
What's he talking about?

357
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,013
Waiting for me at the Hampton Inn.

358
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,598
So...

359
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:44,309
lots of thanks, time to piss off.

360
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,477
We're not going anywhere.

361
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,399
Right.

362
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:54,152
Just so you know,

363
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,529
that's Terror's girlfriend.

364
00:19:56,571 --> 00:20:00,241
- What?
- His fuck pig.

365
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,395
Black Noir's here.

366
00:20:31,338 --> 00:20:32,565
What?

367
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:35,902
It wasn't us... we were cautious.

368
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:38,071
We swapped cars, no toll roads.

369
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:40,073
It's not you. It's me.

370
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,951
He must've tracked me from Becca's.

371
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,328
Billy, what's this all about?

372
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,039
It's complicated.

373
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,624
Becca's not with me.

374
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,543
You... couldn't get her out?

375
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:58,007
She didn't want out.

376
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:02,845
I'll explain everything,

377
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:05,640
but right now we're in
a little bit of trouble.

378
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:07,558
I'm sorry, Judy. I shouldn't have come.

379
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,852
Okay, maybe...

380
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,938
maybe we can make a run for it.

381
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,189
Just get to the car.

382
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:16,567
No, he moves faster than a car.

383
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:21,280
But if he wants to kill us...

384
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,992
he'll have to do it with an audience.

385
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:31,541
This is the fire department.

386
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:33,459
A natural gas leak has been reported.

387
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,837
Everyone out of your homes.

388
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,172
I repeat, a gas leak
has been reported...

389
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,883
Nice one, M.M.

390
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:43,094
Let's hope they stay a while.

391
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:45,388
Ma'am, do you have
any nails, ball bearings,

392
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,932
electrical wiring,
pressurized aerosol products.

393
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,892
I need a can about this big.

394
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,436
Really appreciate it.

395
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,315
Team Britney, 2007.

396
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:57,900
Remember the meltdown?

397
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:00,653
Oh, ooh, yeah, that...

398
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:02,572
But, you know...

399
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:04,407
You're a firecracker.

400
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:06,451
- Mom?
- Oh, hi.

401
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,453
Annie.

402
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,913
Oh, you-you-you look so pretty.

403
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,624
What...?

404
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,346
- What are you doing here?
- I-I'm in town.

405
00:22:15,347 --> 00:22:16,961
I've been texting you for days.

406
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,672
I-I-I wasn't trying to
ambush you, I promise.

407
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:22,175
Did you get any of the
Vietnamese crêpes?

408
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:23,593
'Cause they're dope.

409
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:26,763
No, no, no, I'm good. Thanks.

410
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:32,351
Your mom was telling me

411
00:22:32,353 --> 00:22:33,913
about the hero pageants you used to do.

412
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:36,606
Lucky.

413
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,733
My mom would never let me.

414
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:41,110
Adele did not go in
for that sort of thing.

415
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:44,572
I had to do all my speeches
to a brush in the mirror.

416
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:46,574
I like this one.

417
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:48,576
Mom, this isn't a great time.

418
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:49,952
I-I know that you're busy,

419
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:52,955
but you don't have to
entertain me, I promise.

420
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,707
I-I wanted to see you, sweetheart.

421
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:57,126
I... I miss you.

422
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,259
I think that this is something

423
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:09,013
that we need to discuss in private.

424
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:11,099
Donna, can I tell her?

425
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,184
- Tell me what?
- Look, your mom

426
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,853
is so sorry about the Compound V,

427
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,272
and she understands that
keeping that a secret

428
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,399
really hurt your relationship.

429
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:22,151
Yeah, and that I-I used you as a trophy

430
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:23,945
to make myself feel important.

431
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,321
I know that now.

432
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:28,157
Why are you talking to a
stranger about our relationship?

433
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:29,408
She's not a stranger.

434
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,701
She's your teammate.

435
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:38,209
Annie, the-the whole world
knows about Compound V.

436
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:42,588
I mean, lots of parents did what I did.

437
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:46,300
I... I'm hoping that you'll...

438
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,386
that you'll forgive me.

439
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,679
Please forgive me, Annie.

440
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,267
This is not the time
or the place for this.

441
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:57,270
Look, everyone is upset
about Compound V.

442
00:23:57,311 --> 00:24:00,898
I mean, someone was so upset,
they leaked it to the press.

443
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,025
Can you imagine how
angry that person is?

444
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:05,069
Whoever they are?

445
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:11,450
I'll let you two hash it
out, but I just think...

446
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:15,830
if it was me, I'd be grateful
to have a mom like Donna.

447
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:26,382
Honey, please?

448
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:29,719
I need to get back to set.

449
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,849
Do you need someone to
drive you back to your hotel?

450
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:37,059
No, I'll-I'll-I'll get a cab.

451
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:39,187
Okay.

452
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:40,771
Okay,

453
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,857
now, Queen Maeve, a goddess,

454
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:45,484
but our Empress of the
Otherworld struggles inside.

455
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:48,237
Questions of identity
rock her to her core.

456
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:50,406
- Until she meets...
- Elena.

457
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:52,128
The connection is
immediate, all-consuming.

458
00:24:52,129 --> 00:24:54,702
A sweet sapphic love blossoms,

459
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:56,078
raising Maeve's consciousness

460
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,080
and revealing her own inner truth.

461
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:00,458
She's gay, and it's okay.

462
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,792
- It's...
- Powerful.

463
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,878
She's more than just a superhero now.

464
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,880
She is a symbol.

465
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:07,173
Representation matters.

466
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:10,760
She's #BraveMaeve.

467
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,471
We're recommending a
multipronged image makeover.

468
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,840
First, guest spots on Queer Eye.

469
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:16,890
Then, an exclusive "It Gets Better" PSA.

470
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:18,184
Kimberly Peirce might direct.

471
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:20,146
Grand marshals at the New
York and Chicago Pride,

472
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:21,938
because you are two proud lesbians.

473
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:24,273
You know Maeve is bi, right?

474
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:25,608
Yeah, you know what?

475
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,690
I just feel like lesbian is
a bit of an easier sell.

476
00:25:27,691 --> 00:25:28,691
A bit more cut-and-dry.

477
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:30,071
- Now, for Elena...
- Me?

478
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,364
You're going to love it, yeah.

479
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:32,740
Why am I a part of this shit?

480
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:35,868
We are going with a
polished, tailored look.

481
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:39,664
- That looks like menswear.
- Pew research shows

482
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,305
that two feminine
women in a relationship

483
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:42,875
sends a problematic message.

484
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:44,585
Yeah, this isn't Penthouse Forum.

485
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,462
Americans are more accepting of gays

486
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:49,215
when they're in a clear-cut
gender role relationship.

487
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:51,384
- Like Ellen and Portia.
- Okay.

488
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:52,843
Let's get one thing straight.

489
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:56,931
I have no interest in being
in a public relationship.

490
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:58,182
Oh, you will be compensated.

491
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:00,434
I am not for sale.

492
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,604
Really?

493
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:06,023
You're not going to say anything?

494
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:19,495
- I'll fix this.
- Yeah.

495
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:21,956
Elena.

496
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:23,541
Elena, wait.

497
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,502
If they want a lesbian Ken doll,

498
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:28,212
they can find someone else.

499
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:31,984
I am going to cash in my vacation days

500
00:26:32,008 --> 00:26:33,088
and go stay with my sister.

501
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,052
No. You can't do that.

502
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,888
Why? I'm not under contract.

503
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,890
This is Homelander.

504
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:42,184
Okay? And he's fucking with me.

505
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:43,853
And if you go out there,

506
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:48,274
Elena, there is nowhere you
can go that he won't find you.

507
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:49,650
Please.

508
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:51,444
Stay.

509
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:54,488
I can't protect you if you leave.

510
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,617
But what are we gonna do?

511
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:03,331
We're gonna take that motherfucker down.

512
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:07,126
- You trust me?
- Yeah.

513
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:17,845
Okay.

514
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:19,430
Is this right?

515
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:23,976
Just like Home Alone
except way less delightful.

516
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,647
Butcher?

517
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:31,567
No.

518
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:34,570
It ain't right.

519
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:38,199
What's going on?

520
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,618
That ninja cunt's here for me, isn't he?

521
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,746
Yeah, but you can't go
out there... he'll kill you.

522
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:49,627
So...

523
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,337
So that's it?

524
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:54,715
Expecting a happy ending, were we?

525
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:56,926
Well, I'm sorry, Hughie.

526
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:59,929
It ain't that kind of massage parlor.

527
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,182
Now, I can keep him busy
for a little while, yeah?

528
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:05,935
Give you lot a chance to leg it.

529
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,230
I'm knackered.

530
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:13,734
I could use a little lie-down.

531
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,614
Fuck you.

532
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:20,056
What, am I supposed to be impressed

533
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:22,284
by this blaze of glory jerk-off shit?

534
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:23,744
Guess not.

535
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:27,081
You don't think I thought
about cashing it in after Robin?

536
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:29,125
'Cause I do.

537
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,045
Still.

538
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:35,089
A lot.

539
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:41,178
But I don't.

540
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:49,186
And the thing that kills me
is that your wife is alive.

541
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,730
She just doesn't want you, that's all.

542
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:55,109
Say that again.

543
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:56,569
So you don't have shit.

544
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,196
Welcome to the fucking club.

545
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:03,242
I mean, come on, what do, what
do any of us have besides...?

546
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,748
Who the fuck asked you to come here?

547
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,876
Eh?

548
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:15,045
I don't need your help.

549
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,590
Jesus, you're fucking pathetic.

550
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:20,926
You're so scared of being alone, Hughie.

551
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:22,595
First you latch onto Robin,

552
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,305
then Starlight, and now me.

553
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:25,806
Well, you know what, son?

554
00:29:25,848 --> 00:29:28,476
I ain't interested.

555
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:38,319
Look, just get out of the fucking way.

556
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:45,826
Don't make me move you.

557
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:49,371
You can move him,

558
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,874
but good luck with me.

559
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:27,618
Que se passe-t-il ?

560
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:35,084
She wanted the job.

561
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,086
You have her doing hits?

562
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:39,922
The Albanians have her doing hits.

563
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:42,466
I'm just a girl getting ten percent.

564
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:44,802
- You...
- I'm sorry, pumpkin,

565
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,721
but I told you,

566
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:50,516
she's no kitten.

567
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:53,185
She can make her own choices.

568
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,565
Why?

569
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:03,028
How is this stopping Stormfront?

570
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:06,407
I know you blame
yourself for your brother,

571
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:08,659
I know the rage you feel,

572
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:12,788
but this... this is not the way.

573
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,623
This is poison for your soul.

574
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:16,083
I know.

575
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,799
Come with me, mon coeur.

576
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:30,264
I got my own baby brother killed!

577
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:35,060
He was the only thing
that mattered to me!

578
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:38,314
Stop trying to help me!

579
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:40,691
I don't want your help!

580
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:42,610
I don't understand what you're saying

581
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,695
because you won't teach me!

582
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:53,287
Fuck this.

583
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:54,913
Fuck you.

584
00:31:58,042 --> 00:32:00,586
Go be a monster.

585
00:32:11,404 --> 00:32:12,764
Remember when you were young

586
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:15,309
and the world was full of possibilities?

587
00:32:15,351 --> 00:32:16,852
Before all the mistakes,

588
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:19,647
heartbreaks and disappointments?

589
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:23,067
What if you could go back
to the way things were?

590
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:27,488
I used to be angry, insecure and unsure.

591
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,448
But thanks to the
Church of the Collective,

592
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,409
I now know the kind of man I want to be.

593
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,495
The kind of man who calls out injustice

594
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,288
- when he sees it.
- Stop.

595
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,457
- Come on.
- Hey, dude.

596
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:40,959
That's not cool.

597
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:44,296
The kind of man who
stands up for what's right.

598
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:47,633
Come on, guys, knock it off.

599
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:50,636
The kind of man who sees
the potential in all of us.

600
00:32:50,678 --> 00:32:53,305
So join us at the Church
of the Collective,

601
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:56,725
and be the person you
were always meant to be.

602
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:07,361
That's a bunch of bullshit.

603
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:08,603
Didn't used to be.

604
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:10,364
Church used to mean something.

605
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:12,157
Oh, what, are you a member?

606
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:14,660
I was, long time ago.

607
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:15,786
Hmm.

608
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:17,913
That place used to be pure.

609
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:21,834
And then they just started
letting all kinds of people in,

610
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:24,378
you know?

611
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:27,047
I don't know.

612
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:30,259
So, why don't you tell me?

613
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,428
Well, I think you do know.

614
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:36,306
Some people are quality
and others are...

615
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,350
garbage.

616
00:33:38,392 --> 00:33:40,144
We are rolling.

617
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:42,146
Oh, by the way,

618
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,732
I heard they're retiring you?

619
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,610
So unfair.

620
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,574
Do you have a problem?

621
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,659
Of course not. Why would you say that?

622
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:02,040
Can I have a word? Please?

623
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:06,712
Adam tells me you don't
want to do the scene.

624
00:34:06,754 --> 00:34:08,914
I just can't be a part of
something I don't believe in.

625
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:11,550
Look, I know it's not easy
losing your job. Okay?

626
00:34:11,592 --> 00:34:14,011
When I got fired, I tindered
my way through Barcelona.

627
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,388
Everyone in that city ate my paella.

628
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,890
Fucked a guy with elephantiasis.

629
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,893
But I got through it, and so will you.

630
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,414
Yeah, but I'm still making it happen.

631
00:34:22,434 --> 00:34:24,510
I mean, my A-Trainers sell how
many fucking pairs per year?

632
00:34:24,511 --> 00:34:25,564
Look on the bright side...

633
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:27,446
you served four years
longer than Mr. Marathon.

634
00:34:27,447 --> 00:34:29,318
Now, that is something, okay.

635
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:33,197
But... please.

636
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:36,074
Let me just... talk to Homelander.

637
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:38,702
We both know that's not a good idea.

638
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,496
I'm sorry.

639
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:43,290
I'm not saying the lines.

640
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:45,793
Okay, this can go one of two ways.

641
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:47,753
One: You leave the
Seven with your dignity

642
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:49,296
and your severance package intact.

643
00:34:49,338 --> 00:34:51,590
Or two: You get fired

644
00:34:51,605 --> 00:34:52,965
for breaching your morality clause

645
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:54,551
by shooting up Compound V

646
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,233
and giving yourself a
fucking heart attack

647
00:34:56,234 --> 00:34:58,096
in the fucking process.

648
00:34:58,138 --> 00:35:00,349
It's your choice.

649
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:13,403
You know, the truth is...

650
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:16,073
I've been running my whole life.

651
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:20,410
Think it's time that I
stay put for a while.

652
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:23,372
It's time I went home.

653
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:26,917
I know this is dawn of the Seven.

654
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:31,505
But it's sunset on A-Train.

655
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:34,591
It's been a good run.

656
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:35,884
Cut!

657
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,389
Hey, dude. That was awesome.

658
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:44,226
Awesome? A-Dog, that was fucking gold.

659
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:47,396
Buddy, look, I'm ready to
move on, but how do you feel?

660
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:48,997
You want another one? Just let me know.

661
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:51,817
No, man, go ahead and move on.

662
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:53,099
All right, check it! Moving on!

663
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,636
Tiffany, we need you over at Mo-cap.

664
00:35:54,678 --> 00:35:56,387
- Good day.
- Yeah, going over there now.

665
00:35:57,449 --> 00:35:58,969
Yes, it's true.

666
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:02,411
Vought has all the money and the power.

667
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:05,289
And we have, no offense, jack shit.

668
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,970
We love you, Victoria!

669
00:36:06,971 --> 00:36:09,543
But after Homelander's war crime...

670
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:12,754
...how can I stay quiet

671
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:14,965
and still look my daughter in the eyes?

672
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:16,884
I can't. I know you can't.

673
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:18,093
And guess what.

674
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:21,179
The House Judiciary can't either!

675
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:22,723
Finally!

676
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,474
We are going to hold hearings

677
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:27,519
on Vought and Compound V!

678
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:29,563
Yes! Yes!

679
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,694
Hey, everyone.

680
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:41,992
May I?

681
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:45,829
Thank you.

682
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:48,582
Congresswoman Neuman, everybody.

683
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:50,709
Isn't she great? Didn't
you love that little

684
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:53,837
"Walk Like an Egyptian"
dance she did online?

685
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:55,464
So fun.

686
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,007
I loved it.

687
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:59,301
But fun is not what
we're here for, is it?

688
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:01,583
- No, no, no, no, no, fuck.
- Let me just start by saying

689
00:37:01,584 --> 00:37:03,221
how pleased I am to see you all here.

690
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:05,307
Everyone get the fuck
out! Get the fuck out!

691
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:07,349
- Fuck you. Get out.
- ...that we live in a country

692
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,645
where all your voices can be heard.

693
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:11,897
I know that some of
you are a little upset

694
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:15,442
by that video online of me
stopping the terrorist,

695
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:19,905
and I just want you to
know that I understand.

696
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:22,282
I'm upset, too.

697
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:24,409
I mean, come on, guys.

698
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:26,286
Nobody wants innocent
people to get hurt.

699
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:28,705
Of course not.

700
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,834
But sadly,

701
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:35,796
well, the bad guys,

702
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:38,382
they don't think like us.

703
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:44,012
And so, sometimes...

704
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:45,305
well, these things just happen.

705
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,433
Wait, this happened before?

706
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:50,978
- How many times?
- Well, no, h-hold on, guys.

707
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:55,857
My point is, we all have
the same goals, don't we?

708
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:58,443
- To keep our country safe.
- No.

709
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:01,238
So American lives are the
only ones worth protecting?

710
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,823
Of course not.

711
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:05,826
But if you've served with our
amazing soldiers, like I have,

712
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:09,830
you would know that
freedom comes at a price.

713
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:11,999
You don't speak for us!

714
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,751
Yeah, you don't speak for us!

715
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,169
You don't speak for us!

716
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,211
- You don't speak for us!
- You don't speak for us!

717
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:20,298
All right, all right.
Everyone just calm down.

718
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,009
Calm down. Let's not let your hearts

719
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,290
- get in the way of your heads.
- You don't speak for us!

720
00:38:24,291 --> 00:38:25,345
You don't speak for us!

721
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:27,267
- Everyone just relax.
- You don't speak for us!

722
00:38:27,268 --> 00:38:28,271
You don't speak for us!

723
00:38:28,313 --> 00:38:30,559
- Calm down.
- You don't speak for us!

724
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,979
You don't speak for us!
You don't speak for us!

725
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:35,941
- You don't speak for us!
- Fuck Homelander!

726
00:38:35,942 --> 00:38:37,357
You don't speak for us!

727
00:38:57,127 --> 00:39:00,005
You don't speak for us!
You don't speak for us!

728
00:39:00,047 --> 00:39:01,256
You don't speak for us!

729
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:02,466
All right.

730
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,968
You guys are the real heroes.

731
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,636
God bless you!

732
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,430
Love you guys!

733
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:11,725
You don't speak for us!
You don't speak for us!

734
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:23,699
You guys are all good.

735
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,179
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

736
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:43,673
- It's time.
- Right, lads.

737
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,717
To the taffy room.

738
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:52,516
This is bollocks.

739
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:10,408
This is the taffy room?

740
00:40:12,661 --> 00:40:15,997
An affordable alternative
to privatized health care.

741
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,378
She's a dealer.

742
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:27,968
All right, everyone just calm down.

743
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:30,095
Calm down. Let's not let your hearts...

744
00:40:30,137 --> 00:40:32,055
Oh, you fucking...

745
00:40:33,682 --> 00:40:36,184
You guys, you're the real heroes.

746
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:39,146
You fucking...

747
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:44,359
Fuck, fuck. Fuck!

748
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,793
No one ever said the job was easy.

749
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:03,503
Look, he's just a kid.

750
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:06,214
17 years old. You don't
got to look him in the face.

751
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:09,676
Look, no one's ever achieved
anything without sacrifice.

752
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:10,969
The kid's a hero.

753
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:12,721
Think of it like that.

754
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:15,265
Right. A hero.

755
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,189
Okay.

756
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:30,030
Come in!

757
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,421
Where do you get all these?

758
00:41:46,463 --> 00:41:47,839
Oh, this is just the first batch.

759
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:49,382
I'll have Logan punch up the fear.

760
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:51,218
Logan?

761
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:52,886
My meme-queen.

762
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:55,055
- Hmm.
- So...

763
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:57,432
when you see it on your
uncle's Facebook page,

764
00:41:57,474 --> 00:42:00,518
then you know it's working.

765
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,562
Hmm.

766
00:42:38,682 --> 00:42:40,350
Um...

767
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:42,686
can I ask you something?

768
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:46,314
Well, suppose I got the time.

769
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:48,858
Who's Lenny?

770
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,360
You said I looked like him?

771
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:52,112
Oh.

772
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,781
Billy wouldn't want me to say.

773
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:57,784
Fuck Billy.

774
00:42:57,826 --> 00:43:01,162
Lenny's his little brother.

775
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:05,000
Uh, Butcher... has a brother?

776
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,835
Yeah.

777
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:09,212
Skinny, nervous little bugger.

778
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:10,630
Like you.

779
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,719
Fourth grade.

780
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,888
Little wanker named Dorian Savory

781
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,515
breaks Lenny's nose.

782
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:22,934
Oh, Billy goes to work on him.

783
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:26,771
Was bringing the see-saw down
on Dorian's noggin, wham, wham!

784
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:28,273
Probably gonna top him.

785
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:31,067
Kids, teachers trying
to drag Billy away,

786
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,528
but no... no good, not gonna happen,

787
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:35,322
Dorian's a goner.

788
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:38,783
And then Lenny steps in,

789
00:43:38,825 --> 00:43:42,704
face all bleeding, and leads Billy away

790
00:43:42,746 --> 00:43:46,916
easy, quiet as a lamb.

791
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:49,419
That was Lenny.

792
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:53,048
He had a way of making Billy not be...

793
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:57,385
well, you know... Billy.

794
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:04,225
I think Billy needs someone
like that, you know?

795
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:16,488
Where's Lenny now?

796
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:19,574
Oh, God rest his soul.

797
00:44:19,616 --> 00:44:21,076
What happened?

798
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:14,254
Whoa-whoa-whoa...

799
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:17,215
Easy, easy, Terror, easy. Easy.

800
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:28,685
M.M.! Come on, everybody, out!

801
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:36,651
Out the side door!

802
00:45:36,693 --> 00:45:39,279
Move!

803
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:45,660
Butcher.

804
00:45:45,702 --> 00:45:47,328
Get 'em out of here.

805
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:49,122
Butcher, wait, wait, wait!

806
00:45:49,164 --> 00:45:50,540
What are you...?

807
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:53,835
Butcher! Butcher!

808
00:45:53,877 --> 00:45:56,004
Butcher, what are you doing?!

809
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:57,714
Butcher, you don't...

810
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,549
Don't do this!

811
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:00,967
Butcher!

812
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:05,388
All right, you fucker.

813
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,432
Where are you?

814
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:23,865
So you want to take me on, do you?

815
00:46:23,907 --> 00:46:27,035
Think you got the bollocks?

816
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:29,162
Well, come on, then...

817
00:46:29,204 --> 00:46:30,663
cunt.

818
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:39,373
What the fuck are you doing?!

819
00:46:39,374 --> 00:46:41,674
Get out of here!

820
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:43,635
Oi, gimp cunt!

821
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:46,262
Over here, gimp cunt!

822
00:46:46,264 --> 00:46:47,544
I'm the one you want. Come here!

823
00:47:26,094 --> 00:47:28,555
You kill him...

824
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:31,182
and you can kiss your
fucking career goodbye.

825
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:37,981
I got photos...

826
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:40,233
of Vought's dirty little secret...

827
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:42,777
my wife's son...

828
00:47:42,819 --> 00:47:45,238
Homelander's son.

829
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,158
Now, you lay one fucking finger

830
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,369
on any of us,

831
00:47:51,411 --> 00:47:53,788
and those photos go out of the cloud

832
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:57,917
and into Ronan Farrow's inbox.

833
00:47:57,959 --> 00:48:00,211
And then the whole world will know

834
00:48:00,253 --> 00:48:04,340
that Homelander is nothing
but a filthy fucking rapist

835
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:09,554
and Vought has been hiding
his little laser-eyed bastard.

836
00:48:09,596 --> 00:48:14,267
Now, you cunts went to a lot of
trouble to keep that a secret.

837
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:17,478
I reckon you might want
to keep it that way.

838
00:48:31,618 --> 00:48:34,454
♪ Halle... ♪

839
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:37,582
Mr. Butcher.

840
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:43,004
- Oh, hello, cunt.
- How can I be sure

841
00:48:43,046 --> 00:48:45,423
you actually have the
proof of which you speak?

842
00:48:45,465 --> 00:48:46,591
You can't.

843
00:48:46,633 --> 00:48:48,676
Roll the dice, cunt.

844
00:48:48,718 --> 00:48:51,095
I reckon he'd be more popular

845
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:53,556
than Meghan and Harry's little sprog.

846
00:48:53,598 --> 00:48:55,767
Here's my first and final offer.

847
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:58,353
That information never
sees the light of day,

848
00:48:58,394 --> 00:49:00,688
and I'll call off Black Noir.

849
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:01,939
All right.

850
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:03,858
You got yourself a deal.

851
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,485
Want to shake on it?

852
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:07,862
Put Noir on.

853
00:49:08,905 --> 00:49:11,866
Oi, missus wants a word.

854
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:22,960
Jesus Christ, Billy.

855
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:28,424
- M.M., you all right?
- I'm okay.

856
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:34,722
Do you really have those pictures?

857
00:49:34,764 --> 00:49:36,140
Of course I do.

858
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:51,406
They said there'd be food.

859
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:54,742
Well, this is food for your soul.

860
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:56,786
Go with love.

861
00:49:56,828 --> 00:49:57,954
All right.

862
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,414
Hi.

863
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:01,124
Maeve, oh, my God. Hi.

864
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:02,458
- What brought you here?
- Oh!

865
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,918
Wait, are you...?

866
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,503
Uh... do you want to check this out?

867
00:50:05,545 --> 00:50:07,088
- Oh, fuck no. No.
- Okay.

868
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:09,215
Listen, uh, we should talk.

869
00:50:09,257 --> 00:50:10,425
Yeah.

870
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:13,052
If any of these Moonies

871
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:14,694
are gonna help you
get back in the Seven,

872
00:50:14,695 --> 00:50:16,764
and that's a big if,

873
00:50:16,806 --> 00:50:19,434
then you're gonna need a woman to...

874
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:24,147
tell everyone that you're
not a complete piece of shit.

875
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:26,607
I could be that person for you.

876
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:28,192
Wait, you think I'm a piece of shit?

877
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:29,402
Fuck yeah.

878
00:50:29,444 --> 00:50:32,113
The point is, I can help you.

879
00:50:32,155 --> 00:50:33,823
If you help me.

880
00:50:33,865 --> 00:50:35,658
- Hmm.
- Yeah,

881
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,201
I've got Stormfront. Flying in.

882
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:40,580
I'll take the goi cuon.

883
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:42,582
Nah, no, the bun cha.

884
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:44,000
Does that have peppers?

885
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,418
Thank you.

886
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:34,258
What are you doing in my trailer?

887
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,427
You know, you had no right

888
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:39,347
to talk to my mother
about personal shit.

889
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:41,599
What were you trying to prove?

890
00:51:41,641 --> 00:51:43,893
Okay, sorry. Just trying to help.

891
00:51:43,935 --> 00:51:48,022
She didn't just lie to me
about Compound V, okay?

892
00:51:48,064 --> 00:51:52,151
She lied to me about everything.

893
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:55,488
So don't try and broker some
kind of peace between us,

894
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:59,116
because I don't want it.

895
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:02,995
Wow, that-that...

896
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:05,122
I mean...

897
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:07,875
that...

898
00:52:07,917 --> 00:52:10,253
is a performance.

899
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:14,090
Oh, my God, look, I'm, like, tearing up.

900
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,801
You don't suck, Starlight.

901
00:52:16,843 --> 00:52:19,846
You are Tilda fucking Swinton.

902
00:52:21,222 --> 00:52:23,599
I know you leaked it.

903
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:26,269
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

904
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,420
Not as good.

905
00:52:27,462 --> 00:52:28,596
Magic's gone.

906
00:52:28,638 --> 00:52:30,647
I guess lightning really
doesn't strike twice, huh?

907
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:32,024
Okay, whatever. You know what?

908
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:33,442
I need to get to set, so...

909
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:35,862
That hack-a-limb Gecko,

910
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:38,447
yeah, he stole the V and then you...

911
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:41,826
you leaked it to MSNBC.

912
00:52:41,868 --> 00:52:44,245
Now, what do you think Vought's
gonna feel when I tell them?

913
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:50,084
Well, how do you think
the world will feel

914
00:52:50,126 --> 00:52:53,754
when I tell 'em that
you used to be Liberty?

915
00:52:54,797 --> 00:52:56,632
Wow.

916
00:52:56,674 --> 00:53:00,136
You are a special kind
of poison flower, huh,

917
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,179
going against your own people?

918
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:05,016
You mean fucking white people?

919
00:53:05,057 --> 00:53:06,684
Starlight.

920
00:53:06,726 --> 00:53:08,102
Superheroes.

921
00:53:08,144 --> 00:53:09,729
Don't be racist.

922
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:13,316
Oh, my.

923
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:14,692
Oh, yes.

924
00:53:14,734 --> 00:53:16,736
That is adorable.

925
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:18,988
I do like you.

926
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:21,741
You... you got spunk.

927
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:23,618
You're gonna be a big help to me.

928
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:25,699
What the hell does that mean?

929
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:28,205
Come in!

930
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:37,173
Hello, you two.

931
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:42,261
Not interrupting, am I?

932
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:43,763
No.

933
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:46,307
Just between us girls, right, Starlight?

934
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:48,434
Yeah.

935
00:53:48,476 --> 00:53:50,561
Yeah, that's right.

936
00:53:52,104 --> 00:53:54,565
- See you around.
- Mm-hmm.

937
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,070
Can't wait to shoot our scene together.

938
00:53:59,111 --> 00:54:01,530
Yeah, me, too.

939
00:54:06,452 --> 00:54:08,704
What was that all about?

940
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:11,666
Are you girls friendly?

941
00:54:11,707 --> 00:54:13,042
No, just running lines.

942
00:54:13,084 --> 00:54:14,835
What's up?

943
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:16,921
Uh...

944
00:54:16,963 --> 00:54:18,506
me.

945
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:20,341
- Five points.
- Ah.

946
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:21,676
Mm-hmm.

947
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:25,429
Yeah, people are, uh, checking boxes

948
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:27,598
like "patriotic"

949
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:31,268
and, uh... "unwavering".

950
00:54:36,816 --> 00:54:39,151
I owe you.

951
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:42,405
Well, what are you ever
gonna do to repay me?

952
00:54:49,078 --> 00:54:51,539
Well...

953
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,749
here we are.

954
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:57,420
I'm sorry.

955
00:54:57,461 --> 00:55:01,173
I almost threw in the
towel like a bleeding twat.

956
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:05,219
We're harder than that, isn't we?

957
00:55:06,595 --> 00:55:09,849
I will get your mum back.

958
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:14,437
I swear to God, I'll get your mum back.

959
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:16,772
Just take a little bit longer.

960
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:19,984
You hang in there. All right?

961
00:55:20,026 --> 00:55:22,153
You be a good boy for Judy.

962
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:27,575
Yeah, that's a good lad.

963
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:34,123
Oh.

964
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:37,918
I almost forgot.

965
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,421
I got you something.

966
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:42,673
Terror...

967
00:55:44,133 --> 00:55:46,093
...fuck it.

968
00:55:46,135 --> 00:55:47,803
That's my boy.

969
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:49,847
I'll always protect you.

970
00:55:51,307 --> 00:55:52,349
Mmm.

971
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:56,145
You're all right

972
00:55:56,187 --> 00:55:57,646
- for an old bat.
- Yeah, yeah.

973
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:23,422
