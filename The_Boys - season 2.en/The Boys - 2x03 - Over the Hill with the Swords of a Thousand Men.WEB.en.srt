I said, how long we
gonna be sulkin' about

10
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:15,034
like some poncy
eyeline-wearin' emo twat?

11
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,828
All right, look,

12
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,872
I will say, I lost me
bottle a little bit

13
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:22,792
when I popped you one.

14
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:26,170
So, um...

15
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:28,631
sorry?

16
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,175
There, I said it.

17
00:01:31,217 --> 00:01:33,135
We all square?

18
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,440
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

19
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:48,734
- Easy, easy, kid. Relax.
- I'll fucking kill you!

20
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:50,361
Fucking hell. Kid's stark ravin'.

21
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:52,112
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

22
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:53,989
Come on, breathe, breathe.

23
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,908
You mind?

24
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,368
- Fuckin' hell.
- Now, breathe.

25
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,578
- Just breathe. Okay?
- Okay.

26
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,163
- Okay. I'm fine.
- All right.

27
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:02,456
- All right.
- I'm fine.

28
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:05,584
What's the ETA?

29
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,146
A team's on the way... they'll
be there in a few hours.

30
00:02:08,147 --> 00:02:09,713
- A few hours?
- I'm a civilian,

31
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,423
I can't just push a button anymore.

32
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:12,842
The target's secure?

33
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,093
No one's seen him?

34
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,854
We're three fucking
miles offshore, Grace...

35
00:02:15,855 --> 00:02:17,054
what do you think?

36
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:19,473
I think if there's a way to
screw this up, you'll find it.

37
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:24,854
Look, I just want me wife back.

38
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,438
I know.

39
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,691
Bring Langley the terrorist,
and you'll have her.

40
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,360
Hey, you ever hear

41
00:02:31,402 --> 00:02:33,737
of an old Supe called Liberty?

42
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,531
The fuck's that got to do with anything?

43
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:38,158
I'm not sure yet.

44
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:40,619
How's your crew holding up?

45
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:41,996
Yeah, all good.

46
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,197
Uh, we are having a few
laughs here, I'll tell ya that.

47
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:45,541
The target is

48
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:46,876
the girl's brother?

49
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,502
Yeah, so?

50
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:51,130
You don't think it
compromises her allegiances?

51
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:54,300
Well...

52
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,844
if it comes to that,

53
00:02:56,886 --> 00:02:58,971
I'll neutralize her.

54
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:01,891
The compassion you show
your team is truly touching.

55
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,859
It was just a figure of speech, mate.

56
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:28,602
You remember in the camp...

57
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:34,108
you were so hungry
you'd cry all the time

58
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:37,778
and I snuck into the storage
room to steal you rice?

59
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:43,993
I took care of you.

60
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:50,332
I still will.

61
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:59,675
I also remember the time they
came after you for stealing.

62
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:04,346
I said no, it was me, and
they broke my hands.

63
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,725
You might be my big sister.

64
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:11,437
But I protect you too.
We protect each other.

65
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:14,940
You know...

66
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:18,360
the Americans will torture me.

67
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:21,488
I won't let them.

68
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,324
How will you stop them?

69
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,534
Hmm?

70
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,664
You have to let me go.

71
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,586
I won't attack anyone.

72
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,671
I won't hurt anyone.

73
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:44,636
I'm your brother...

74
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,848
we only have each other now.

75
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,684
Please.

76
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:07,868
I'm sorry.

Sí.

107
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,819
What is that?

108
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,112
That's Spanish.

109
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,740
Monday mornings we have
breakfast in español.

110
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,203
Hey, Ryan.

111
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,872
Do you want to stay in
here and learn Spanish,

112
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:18,874
or do you want to come
outside and have some fun

113
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,167
with your old man, huh?

114
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:22,009
I think that he needs to...

115
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,462
Mom, is it okay if I go with him?

116
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,464
Yeah, of course it's okay, right, Mom?

117
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,825
Come on.

118
00:08:26,826 --> 00:08:29,078
Sure.

119
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:33,305
There you go, champ.

120
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,228
You guys fucking ready?

121
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,813
Okay, we pan up, we
see Homelander flying

122
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,774
towards Martinez's Miami mansion.

123
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,442
And Martinez make a run for it.

124
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:46,944
Octavio, vámonos!

125
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,695
Vámonos, mi amigo!

126
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,447
Octavio accelerates but Homelander

127
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:53,325
laser blasts out the tires... bzz...

128
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,701
Boom!

129
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:57,371
Martinez gets out of the car,

130
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,831
dazed, looks up...

131
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,250
Homelander.

132
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,252
You're under arrest.

133
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:04,878
Oh-ho-ho.

134
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,505
And he slaps the handcuffs on Martinez,

135
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,756
the cops take him away,

136
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:09,758
Homelander turns to the other heroes.

137
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,969
We should work together more often.

138
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,763
You mean like a team-up?

139
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:16,515
Exactly.

140
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,226
All seven of us.

141
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,312
Holy shit.

142
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:25,274
Holy shit.

143
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,359
That is the moment

144
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:31,196
the Seven became...

145
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,698
the Seven.

146
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,741
Rousing music.

Cut to black.

151
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,297
- That is amazing.
- Thank you.

152
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,673
Wow, I am very impressed.

153
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,300
Thank you so much.

154
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,802
And, gang, that's just the teaser.

155
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:55,804
Look, this is not just a superhero...

156
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:58,765
You look like shit.

157
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,225
Had a big night.

158
00:10:01,481 --> 00:10:03,561
And I want to shoot the
whole thing hand-held, right?

159
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:04,955
Very Greengrass, very grounded.

160
00:10:04,996 --> 00:10:07,107
I want to take the audience
and literally put them...

161
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:08,509
boom... right there in the action.

162
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,002
But what's the plan on Translucent?

163
00:10:10,044 --> 00:10:12,364
That's a great question. Okay,
we're gonna take a stuntman,

164
00:10:12,365 --> 00:10:14,075
put him in a jumpsuit
and just CG him out.

165
00:10:14,117 --> 00:10:16,950
And... fuck, I don't want to jinx this,

166
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:19,328
but Lin-Manuel Miranda
wants to do the voice.

167
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,572
- I love Hamilton. Oh, man.
- The world loves Hamilton!

168
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,539
- Oh, my God, you think he'll do a...
- Excuse me.

169
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,660
-I'm sorry to interrupt this lovefest,
-No, of course.

170
00:10:25,662 --> 00:10:27,502
- I just want to be a part of it.
- Understood.

171
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:28,879
Um, this...

172
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,464
- Great work.
- Thank you so much.

173
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:33,467
This script is a great start.

174
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,385
Really good bones.

175
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,596
Uh, I just have a few headlines.

176
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,357
Yeah, totally. Listen,
we can tweak dialogue

177
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:40,718
right up to the day of production.

178
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:43,226
Yeah, it's not really
tweaks. It's more...

179
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,771
global.

180
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,315
Okay, yeah. What are we, um...

181
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:49,941
What are-what are we thinking?

182
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,402
Oh, um, like, uh...

183
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:55,364
you write all women as either
unknowable Hitchcock bitches

184
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,157
or Michael Bay fuck dolls.

185
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:59,826
I mean, I get that a lifetime
of jerking off to Transformers

186
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,748
didn't exactly make you
popular with the ladies,

187
00:11:01,749 --> 00:11:03,580
but, um, a little effort would be nice.

188
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:04,873
You know what I'm saying?

189
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:06,166
Um, excuse me,

190
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,667
but I do have two sisters.

191
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:08,877
Thank you very much.

192
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,879
- Oh.
- And, uh, excuse me,

193
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:13,173
but Homelander really loves this script.

194
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:15,926
- So...
- Oh, okay. Where is he?

195
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,808
Ashley?

196
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:27,604
Um, okay. Okay. Okay, uh,

197
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,566
just, you know, continue
doing what you're doing.

198
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:30,982
Um, I just have to get to my...

199
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,526
I have to... I have a...

200
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,167
Uh, I just have to get to my next thing.

201
00:11:34,168 --> 00:11:37,155
I have a, um, I have a-a noon...

202
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,576
Can someone open this, please?!

203
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,790
- Okay.
- Okay!

204
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:48,500
I got a few more headlines.

205
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:52,879
Mr. Edgar.

206
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,841
Sir, if this is all true, I will
get a strategy together

207
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,676
with crisis management and PR.

208
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,011
- We're fine for now, Ashley.
- Sir, is it true?

209
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,389
- What they're saying?
- We're investigating.

210
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,932
Sir, I have to tell you something.

211
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,392
We have to tell Homelander,

212
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:07,352
and I have to admit
something to you. I...

213
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,939
You don't have the faintest
idea where Homelander is.

214
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:14,109
He will know when I want him to know.

215
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:16,111
Just keep the rest of the infants on 99

216
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:18,738
in check, will you?

217
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,414
...and if you are just tuning in,

218
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:29,708
we have some major breaking news.

219
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,043
Superheroes are not born but made,

220
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:36,631
in fact created by a chemical
serum, Compound V,

221
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,718
produced and administered
by Vought International...

222
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,511
...the company that has been

223
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:44,389
the corporate face of
superheroes for decades.

224
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,016
Now, we don't know

225
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,392
where their superpowers

226
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,227
- actually came from.
- What... did you do?

227
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,271
I don't know what you're talking about.

228
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:52,372
Oh, come on.

229
00:12:52,414 --> 00:12:54,566
I saw you with the V in your hand.

230
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:58,028
Yeah, and you let me
walk away with it, so...

231
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,863
this is kind of on you, too.

232
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:02,365
If I go down, you come with me.

233
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,534
Pretty sure they'd kill us both.

234
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,414
You don't get it.

235
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:14,211
You don't fuck with the money.

236
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:17,797
You never fuck with the money.

237
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:23,261
We're gonna lose everything...
I mean, cars, houses, bonuses...

238
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,264
There are more important things.

239
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:30,185
You know, the only
people that say that...

240
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:33,271
are the people who grew up with money.

241
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,273
...provided evidence

242
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,609
proving Vought has been
administering Compound V

243
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:40,570
to children for decades.

244
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,656
Our very own reporting suggests

245
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,408
the parents also received
a very generous payment.

246
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,452
- It started when I was nine.
- Now, after the kids

247
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,996
were treated with Compound V,
they were then monitored...

248
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:53,416
I was at the mall.

249
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,877
And we, uh...

250
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:58,922
we passed the pet store...

251
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:06,513
...and I heard the goldfish
begging for their lives.

252
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:08,557
They were begging.

253
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:16,356
And after that, I...

254
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:20,569
The beach, the aquarium, Red Lobster...

255
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,913
I mean, I thought I was
going crazy, you know?

256
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,627
But my mom said it was a gift.

257
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,259
That I was born this way.

258
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,388
But I wasn't.

259
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,978
It didn't have to be this way.

260
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,188
- I could've been normal.
- But early reports

261
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,190
seem to suggest the first
manifestation of powers

262
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,067
can cause fear and anxiety

263
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,694
in the affected children,

264
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,446
especially if they are
not carefully guided

265
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:05,905
through the process.

266
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:09,284
So far, Vought has refused

267
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,202
to release a statement.

268
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,331
Likewise, Dr. Jonah Vogelbaum,
former C.S.O. at the company,

269
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,374
refusing comment.

270
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,793
He's been in seclusion since
an undisclosed accident

271
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,855
- left him paralyzed.
- Uh, hey.

272
00:15:20,865 --> 00:15:21,865
Is this you?

273
00:15:21,897 --> 00:15:23,991
Vogelbaum all but
disappearing from public life.

274
00:15:24,033 --> 00:15:25,133
You did it.

275
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:26,718
We did it.

276
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,346
Um, call me. Call me back
when you get a chance.

277
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,187
...on their stock price,

278
00:15:31,188 --> 00:15:32,641
which is already falling today,

279
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,682
- Did what?
- signaling a huge trend

280
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,436
that could be potentially catastrophic

281
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,271
to Vought's bottom line.

282
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:41,274
You did this?

283
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:45,487
Uh, yeah. S-Starlight did,
mostly, I'm pretty sure,

284
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:49,240
but I just gave her an old alley-oop.

285
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,868
Hughie.

286
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,453
Hughie, yes!

287
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:54,996
- Okay.
- Hughie!

288
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:56,790
Dude, look at what you fucking did.

289
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,583
- Oh, my God.
- You lads touchin' yer tips?

290
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,385
Look at what the kid just did.

291
00:16:00,386 --> 00:16:01,628
Me and Starlight, but yeah.

292
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,963
- Petit Hughie?
- The fucking kid.

293
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,715
- Mm!
- Oh, shit.

294
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:06,966
Yes!

295
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,386
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Nice one.

296
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,429
That's all you got?

297
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,891
We've been trying to
do this shit for years.

298
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,768
Vought's finally fucking going down,

299
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,395
the kid did it, and "nice one"?

300
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,313
All right, real nice one.

301
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,609
You can't even give me this, can you?

302
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,696
Not one goddamn win.

303
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,906
I'll tell you what.

304
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,574
When we're all done here,

305
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,535
I'll buy you a nice,
big, family size bottle

306
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:36,913
of top-shelf lube and
I'll tickle your balls

307
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:39,708
till you beg me to stop
and even then I won't.

308
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,042
I just won't do it.

309
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:45,046
But right now, we got a
Supe terrorist below deck

310
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:48,383
and shit could go sideways just like...

311
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:57,016
So all of ya, keep your fucking
eyes on the ball, yeah?

312
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,569
Don't worry about him.

313
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,028
Yeah, fuck him.

314
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,321
You did great.

315
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,794
Isn't this great?

316
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:27,130
Yeah.

317
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:30,550
Your mom ever bring you up here?

318
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:31,968
No.

319
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,344
Nah.

320
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,805
Of course not.

321
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:39,476
You see, that is why a
boy needs his father.

322
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:45,064
Hey, I think it's time.

323
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:49,027
Yeah. You ready?

324
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,864
Um... ready for what?

325
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:54,908
To jump.

326
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,503
Wait, you can't be serious.

327
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,463
I'm not going to jump.

328
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:10,340
Ryan, you're my son.

329
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:13,510
You can fly, just like me.

330
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:17,096
I-I... I don't want to.

331
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:20,099
You take a big, deep
breath, you step off

332
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:21,726
and your body will just do the rest.

333
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,019
It'll just take over.

334
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,813
But I-I can't fly.

335
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,534
I'll just fall right off
of here and get...

336
00:18:26,575 --> 00:18:27,785
Hey, hey, hey, hey, buddy.

337
00:18:27,827 --> 00:18:30,276
You're gonna love it. I promise.

338
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,861
I'm nothing like you. I-I can't fly.

339
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:33,655
You can. You can.

340
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,073
I promise you can.

341
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,661
Dad, please.

342
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:42,288
Please, don't make me jump.

343
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,958
Aw.

344
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,252
Buddy.

345
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,965
You called me Dad.

346
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:05,728
Ryan.

347
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,730
God. Ryan!

348
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:08,898
Hey. Hey, hey.

349
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,316
What did you do?

350
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:13,178
It's fine. It's a 20-foot drop. Relax.

351
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:14,279
Inhuman fucking monster.

352
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,600
- Come here.
- Don't help him up.

353
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:17,824
- Let him do it himself.
- Come here. Baby, hey.

354
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,659
Hey, Ryan, I need you to wake up.

355
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:22,412
Baby, can you hear me? I'm right here.

356
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,173
I don't think he's breathing.

357
00:19:24,202 --> 00:19:25,922
- He's fine.
- I don't think he's breathing.

358
00:19:25,923 --> 00:19:27,792
- I don't think he's...
- Mom?

359
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,460
- Hi. Hi.
- Look. See?

360
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,879
- Told ya.
- Hi, sweetie.

361
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,255
Are you hurt?

362
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:33,423
Does anything feel broken?

363
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,144
- Oh, for God's sake, broken?
- Let me see.

364
00:19:35,185 --> 00:19:37,185
Come on, look at him.
There's not a scratch on him.

365
00:19:37,186 --> 00:19:39,512
You know why? 'Cause he's my son.

366
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:41,264
And you, you...

367
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:42,757
...you're raising him to be a pussy.

368
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,559
You don't get to tell me
how to raise my son.

369
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,643
I'm his father.

370
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,445
You don't get to say
that after what you did.

371
00:19:47,446 --> 00:19:49,355
What I did to you...

372
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,190
was give you a son,

373
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,192
that you are raising

374
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:55,278
like a little girl.

375
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,654
Let go of me.

376
00:19:56,696 --> 00:20:00,283
- He's mine.
- Get your hands off of her!

377
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:13,046
Good boy.

378
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,756
See?

379
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,717
- I told you.
- What?

380
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:18,799
You're just like me, Ryan.

381
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,303
No, I'm not like you.

382
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:21,945
I'm nothing like you!
I fucking hate you!

383
00:20:21,946 --> 00:20:22,989
Leave us alone!

384
00:20:23,031 --> 00:20:24,849
Hey, hey, it's okay. I'm not angry.

385
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,477
- Ryan.
- Go away!

386
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,562
- Buddy, it's o...
- Leave us alone!

387
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:32,065
Ryan, this is a good thing.

388
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:52,043
So, um...

389
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:59,509
These are horrible,
powdered cheese things,

390
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,011
but, um, if you're hungry?

391
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:07,684
Fuck you.

392
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:10,436
So you do speak English.

393
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:16,609
Thirsty?

394
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,660
You know,

395
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:28,705
the way you talk with your sister...

396
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:30,915
it's no sign language I ever seen.

397
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:37,714
I just want to help her.

398
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:43,761
I can help her.

399
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,596
Tu comprends?

400
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,016
You understand?

401
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:56,274
The night our parents were murdered...

402
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:01,070
...Kimiko just stopped talking.

403
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:02,905
Can't talk.

404
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,783
She's never made a sound since.

405
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,453
In the camp,

406
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:12,290
we were alone week after week,

407
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,918
just the two of us, for years.

408
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,633
We... came up with a language

409
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:25,511
so we could get through it.

410
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:31,017
I-It saved us.

411
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:33,770
Both of us.

412
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:39,942
Will you teach me?

413
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:53,539
Please.

414
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,418
Fuck you.

415
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:10,223
I think your sister is very special.

416
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:15,603
And she loves you very much.

417
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:11,742
I don't know anything about this
Compound V monkey business.

418
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,369
If someone gave it to my little Maeve,

419
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:15,204
I sure as hell didn't know.

420
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:17,206
Bullshit he didn't know.

421
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:18,666
I remember this one weekend

422
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,585
where he made me do
three mall appearances

423
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,211
and a photo shoot for Teen Vogue,

424
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:25,631
all to get the cash for my
braces, which he then blew

425
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:28,050
at the five-dollar table
at Circus Circus.

426
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:29,427
Maybe this is what

427
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,469
we've been waiting for.

428
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,430
What do you mean?

429
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,099
They've lied to you from
the beginning, all of them.

430
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,101
You don't owe them anything.

431
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:38,983
Maybe this is our chance
to leave while we can.

432
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,313
Elena...

433
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:43,357
if we do that, you know what'll happen.

434
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:46,986
I'll call you back.

435
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,742
Not, uh, interrupting, am I?

436
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,368
No, of course not.

437
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,495
Great.

438
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:09,050
It's funny, you know, uh...

439
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:14,764
...of all the people here,

440
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:18,267
I've known you the longest.

441
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:20,686
Yeah.

442
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:26,108
Sometimes it, um,

443
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:29,779
just seems like you're the
only person I can lean on.

444
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,490
Yeah, I... I-I feel the same way.

445
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:38,287
You do?

446
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,957
Of course.

447
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,428
You...

448
00:25:55,513 --> 00:25:57,348
Oh... fuck.

449
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,225
Life, huh?

450
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:05,273
It's crazy.

451
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,401
Who's Elena?

452
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:10,736
Elena's an old friend.

453
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,535
Since when do you have friends?

454
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:21,622
I was just venting about
all this fucking bullshit.

455
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:24,041
What bullshit?

456
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,543
Wait, you haven't heard?

457
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,129
Where have you been?

458
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,723
What the fuck?

459
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,391
This is the NYPD.

460
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:42,393
This boat's been reported stolen,

461
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:43,728
and you're all under arrest.

462
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:44,937
I repeat. This is the NYPD.

463
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:46,647
This boat's been reported stolen...

464
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:48,609
I thought you said this
boat belongs to a friend.

465
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:50,693
Gather on deck and get
your hands in the air now.

466
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:54,780
Well, a stranger is just a
friend you ain't met yet.

467
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:56,182
Don't fuck this up.

468
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:57,558
I ain't gonna fuck it up.

469
00:26:57,573 --> 00:26:59,053
Vought's almost toast,

470
00:26:59,054 --> 00:27:00,202
we're almost home free...

471
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:01,924
I said I ain't gonna
fuck it up, all right.

472
00:27:01,925 --> 00:27:04,165
Ahoy, gents.

473
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,208
I am the captain of My Big Wet Dream.

474
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:10,588
I'm holding papers, signed by the owner,

475
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,715
for the lease of this vessel.

476
00:27:12,757 --> 00:27:15,676
So there must be some
kind of misunderstanding...

477
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:17,511
Look out!

478
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:22,058
Get his hands!

479
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:36,947
Time to go!

480
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,576
Hey, what are you doing?
We gotta help 'em.

481
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:42,218
Trust me, they're already dead.

482
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:43,344
You don't know that.

483
00:27:43,345 --> 00:27:44,497
- We have to try.
- Hughie.

484
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:46,498
Literally everyone is on
their way here right now.

485
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:48,125
We stay here, we die, too.

486
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,812
What?

487
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,064
I wasn't the one who fucked that up.

488
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,081
I know how you feel.

489
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:28,666
I'm a freak, too.

490
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,918
Oh, you shoot a fucking bow and arrow.

491
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,420
I'm amphibious.

492
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:35,423
Okay, just... just give me the phone.

493
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:36,841
Cancel the call.

494
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,260
Postmating Papa John's isn't gonna help.

495
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:41,011
How do you know what helps?

496
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,596
You don't know anything about me.

497
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,392
Let's just recite the
Fifteen Tenets, together.

498
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:47,794
No, fuck you

499
00:28:47,806 --> 00:28:48,966
and your creepy shit, Eagle.

500
00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:50,079
I'm hungry.

501
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,899
Deep, it's time.

502
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:55,276
Time for what?

503
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:56,735
For you. It's your time.

504
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,237
To get back into the Seven.

505
00:28:58,279 --> 00:28:59,488
What?

506
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:02,533
This came from Alastair himself.

507
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:04,702
Holy shit.

508
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,245
Who?

509
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:07,705
Alastair Adana, the...

510
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,206
the leader of the Church.

511
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,375
He sits in the First Chair.

512
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:14,003
Cool.

513
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:16,630
Guys, with everything going on,

514
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,466
I just, I don't think
I can do it right now.

515
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:19,633
No, Deep.

516
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,635
This is your journey.

517
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:22,970
You're ready.

518
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:24,972
You have been ready all along.

519
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:28,559
Now, get out there and be a hero.

520
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:35,232
My dad always used to say,

521
00:29:35,234 --> 00:29:36,674
"Where there's smoke, there's fire".

522
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:39,069
So Vought lied to us about Compound V.

523
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,280
What else are they lying to us about?

524
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:43,282
We're down 68% in morning trading,

525
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:44,992
20% in the last 15 minutes.

526
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:46,827
- It hits 19, start a buyback.
- Yes, sir.

527
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:48,813
Jesus. What about the pharmaceuticals?

528
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:50,894
Pfizer's circling, "dismayed
at our lack of ethics".

529
00:29:50,895 --> 00:29:52,066
Investor lawsuits,

530
00:29:52,108 --> 00:29:53,708
breach of fiduciary
duty, non-disclosure.

531
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,149
We have exposure for fraud, assault,

532
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,301
infliction of bodily harm...

533
00:29:56,343 --> 00:29:58,088
all policy exclusions, no coverage.

534
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,131
We have two options.

535
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:01,008
Option one, deny.

536
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,635
High risk, high reward.

537
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:04,762
But if we deny and they nail us,

538
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,180
if there is a legit whistleblower,

539
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:07,389
there's no coming back.

540
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:08,871
That's bankruptcy, criminal charges,

541
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:10,601
ten to 15 for everyone in this room.

542
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:12,520
Option two, mea culpa.

543
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,313
They've called it.

544
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:15,731
Trading's halted.

545
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:19,902
Stan.

546
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:23,656
We got to put out a statement.

547
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:25,658
Which one is it?

548
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:28,953
Stan.

549
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:33,040
A power drink can, Frenchie?

550
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:34,542
You're a goddamn idiot.

551
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,502
I was trying to help her.

552
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:39,797
Where the hell are your mates?

553
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,238
New deal... you gotta bring him in.

554
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:43,008
Grace, we're three miles offshore.

555
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,927
You just crashed a police helicopter.

556
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:47,221
Not exactly keeping a low profile.

557
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:50,808
All right, where do you want us to go?

558
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,351
CIA safe house Hazlet.

559
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:53,644
Be there in 30.

560
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:55,563
And Butcher?

561
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:56,772
Yeah?

562
00:30:56,814 --> 00:30:59,358
Please be careful.

563
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,152
I will.

564
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:05,990
Fuck me.

565
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,906
Please leave your name and number

566
00:31:09,907 --> 00:31:12,121
and a message after the beep.

567
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:16,542
Hey, uh, Annie, it's me again.

568
00:31:16,584 --> 00:31:20,504
I was just wondering, have
you ever seen the music video

569
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:23,549
for that Billy Joel song
"You're Only Human"?

570
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:26,218
There's this kid and
he's climbing up a bridge

571
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,178
and he's-he's gonna kill himself,

572
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,100
but then Billy Joel steps
out with his harmonica

573
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:31,599
and tells him stop,

574
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,601
you just have to wait
for your second wind,

575
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:37,605
and now I-I feel like I'm-I'm that kid

576
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,607
and I'm gonna drown,

577
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:41,650
and...

578
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:47,364
...and thank God I found my second wind

579
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:50,284
because it's-it's you.

580
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:52,328
You're my second wind.

581
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:57,166
Um,

582
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:59,877
look, I know it's exciting,
uh, taking down Vought

583
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,839
and being like James
Bond and everything,

584
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:05,799
but you've got to be careful,

585
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:09,011
because that stuff can
go to shit really quick...

586
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:11,847
and you wind up hurting
the people that...

587
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:14,850
you love.

588
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:17,019
Like the way that I hurt you.

589
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:19,813
Um...

590
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:22,107
Anyhoo...

591
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:25,527
...that's all I wanted to say.

592
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:27,112
Second wind.

593
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:28,155
Fuck.

594
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:30,699
Um, okay, thanks.

595
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:32,785
Bye.

596
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:57,017
I know I don't come up

597
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:00,562
to 99 enough and I apologize for that.

598
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:05,484
But times like this
tend to give us clarity,

599
00:33:05,526 --> 00:33:08,445
don't they?

600
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:12,157
You and me are partners, after all.

601
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:14,785
A symbiotic part of a larger thing,

602
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:19,331
a living thing named Vought.

603
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:20,916
And that's how we'll get through this,

604
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:24,044
together, as Vought.

605
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:25,838
But, sir...

606
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:30,509
...I got to say...

607
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:37,808
...we didn't know about
this Compound V shit.

608
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,436
- None of us.
- Is that so?

609
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:42,438
Well, we're all victims here, A-Train,

610
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:44,815
but we'll get to the
bottom of it, I promise.

611
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:47,484
Right now, catching
this Super terrorist is...

612
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:48,777
Villain.

613
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,906
Super... villain.

614
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:54,992
Sure. Whatever.

615
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,910
It must be our priority,

616
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:58,704
and it changes the conversation.

617
00:33:58,746 --> 00:34:01,790
So you want us to go out there?

618
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:03,625
Now?

619
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:07,880
I mean, we still need to be
prepped by Legal and PR.

620
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:10,215
We'll be eaten alive out there.

621
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:12,337
- There's no time for that.
- Well, I'm sorry,

622
00:34:12,338 --> 00:34:15,512
but I don't think we
have to damage control

623
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:16,889
your fuck-up.

624
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,308
Hey, guys.

625
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:21,351
Enough.

626
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,563
We gotta pull together here.

627
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:27,441
- Thank you, Homelander.
- Shh! Not you.

628
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:30,235
Us.

629
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:32,279
The Seven.

630
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,117
See, it doesn't matter who made us

631
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:40,662
or how we got here, the point is...

632
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:42,623
we are here.

633
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:45,209
Together.

634
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,877
Family.

635
00:34:48,796 --> 00:34:50,714
You guys...

636
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,635
...you are my real family.

637
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,097
This guy...

638
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:01,058
he doesn't care about us.

639
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,977
We're not his partners,
we're his product.

640
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:07,064
So who gives a shit if Vought
burns to the fucking ground?

641
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,345
You should think before you
say something you don't mean.

642
00:35:09,346 --> 00:35:10,526
Really, should I?

643
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:13,737
We are not Vought.

644
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:16,698
You see, companies, they come and go,

645
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,992
but talent...

646
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:21,578
talent is forever.

647
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:25,499
The world still needs superheroes,

648
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:28,293
and that, family,

649
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:30,128
that's what we are.

650
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:34,466
So let's get out there
and do what it is we do.

651
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:37,678
Let's take this cocksucker down.

652
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,975
Fuck Vought, huh?

653
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:45,394
I did not see that coming from you.

654
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:47,646
Maybe you don't know me that well.

655
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:49,857
Maybe I don't.

656
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,280
How far?

657
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:57,906
A mile, right there.

658
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:09,334
- What the fuck was that?
- What the hell was that?

659
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,510
Take the wheel!

660
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,445
We lost power.

661
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:50,709
Everyone, off the boat, now!

662
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:54,004
Frenchie, grab the winch.

663
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:00,594
Come on, let's go,
let's go, let's go! Get in!

664
00:37:00,596 --> 00:37:02,076
Come on, come on! Let's go, let's go!

665
00:37:02,077 --> 00:37:03,972
Fuck!

666
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:06,600
- Go on. Frenchie, start it up!
- Go, go, go!

667
00:37:06,642 --> 00:37:08,226
Go, go, go!

668
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,946
Look, there. Head for the storm drain.

669
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:37,047
Oh, shit.

670
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:50,560
Butcher! What are you doing?

671
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:51,728
Butcher!

672
00:37:58,151 --> 00:37:59,945
Stop...!

673
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:31,101
Fucking diabolical.

674
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:40,235
Where's Hughie?

675
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:43,071
Hughie!

676
00:38:45,032 --> 00:38:47,451
Oh, geez.

677
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:50,203
You all right?

678
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:51,705
Come on, son.

679
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:53,040
We got to leg it... Deep's here,

680
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:54,666
and the Seven won't be far behind.

681
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:56,376
Um, you know what?

682
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:57,627
Okay, you guys go ahead.

683
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:59,212
You guys go ahead. I'm good.

684
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,839
Eh? What?

685
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:04,593
Just gonna sit here and
wait, i-if you don't mind.

686
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:06,219
What the fuck are you waiting for?

687
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:09,723
My second wind.

688
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:14,227
All right, son.

689
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:15,937
Come on.

690
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:19,900
- Come on.
- Get your fucking hands off of me!

691
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:22,152
Geez.

692
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:24,988
All right, fine. Suit yourself.

693
00:39:26,907 --> 00:39:28,867
All right!

694
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:30,535
Come on, let's go.

695
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:35,332
Whoa.

696
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,667
We can't leave the kid, man.

697
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,753
Pinocchio is staying put.

698
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:41,797
Have at it.

699
00:39:51,098 --> 00:39:52,265
Ugh.

700
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:53,850
Hey, kid.

701
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,894
What are you doing here?

702
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,231
Uh...

703
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:06,530
You ain't going...

704
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:07,906
I ain't going.

705
00:40:09,533 --> 00:40:12,202
They're gonna be here any second.

706
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:15,038
Probably.

707
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,257
Asshole.

708
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:26,925
Yup.

709
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,192
This way.

710
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,612
Frenchie.

711
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,700
Hey, Butcher.

712
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:53,285
Petit Hughie.

713
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:56,163
Hey, the kid's falling apart.

714
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:57,622
You know that, right?

715
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:59,584
Well, what'd you expect?
He's a fucking civilian.

716
00:40:59,585 --> 00:41:01,126
No, no, no, it's not just him.

717
00:41:01,168 --> 00:41:02,752
It's all of us.

718
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:04,171
Move the feet.

719
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:06,882
Just move the feet. Come on.

720
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,425
Move.

721
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,146
We're at our breaking point,

722
00:41:10,147 --> 00:41:12,053
at each other's throats,

723
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:13,763
and you keep pushing us and pushing.

724
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:16,641
- It's like...
- Right over the fucking finish line.

725
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:18,935
We just need to keep our shit together

726
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,979
a little bit longer.

727
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:22,189
Okay?

728
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,024
We hand the cunt over,

729
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:26,818
and I get Becca and you get your girls.

730
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,580
- Butcher, Butcher,
- We're right fucking...

731
00:41:28,581 --> 00:41:30,141
- Butcher, Butcher.
- We're right there.

732
00:41:30,142 --> 00:41:31,948
Hughie's not gonna make it.

733
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,117
And you need that kid,

734
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,661
more than any one of us.

735
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:38,872
He's your canary.

736
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:40,916
My canary?

737
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:43,752
You let your canary die,

738
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:46,296
how you gonna know
when you've gone too far?

739
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:47,881
Oh.

740
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:50,926
I mean, what a load of bollocks.

741
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,641
Hell, I tried, all right?

742
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:59,643
The kid doesn't want a part of me,

743
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,603
so fuck him.

744
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:08,568
Come on.

745
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:17,118
Lucy.

746
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,954
I promise we'll harvest your blubber.

747
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:21,315
Jesus Christ.

748
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:24,042
Deep.

749
00:42:24,084 --> 00:42:25,377
- Homelander.
- Hey.

750
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:26,586
- Hey.
- What happened?

751
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:27,920
They killed her. They
fucking killed her, man.

752
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:29,171
- What?
- I just was trying to help out.

753
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,464
- You know, I got some intel on the boat.
- Okay...

754
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,105
We started to cut them
off and then, fuck,

755
00:42:32,106 --> 00:42:33,426
they just ran right into her.

756
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,929
I'm so sorry. I was just,
like, gonna try to stop them.

757
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:37,513
- I tried to cut them off...
- Okay. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

758
00:42:37,514 --> 00:42:39,098
So you're saying th-there's
people with the terrorist?

759
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:40,819
Look at me. You're
saying they're not alone?

760
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,018
I think so.

761
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,020
All right. Did you get a
good look at them, or...?

762
00:42:44,021 --> 00:42:45,146
Not really.

763
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:46,856
I was too busy worrying about Lucy.

764
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:49,150
Oh, Jesus. Right. Lucy.

765
00:42:49,152 --> 00:42:51,192
But I think they went
off in the storm drains.

766
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:52,904
Can't be too far.

767
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:56,324
Uh, who invited you, exactly?

768
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:57,701
Starlight.

769
00:42:57,742 --> 00:43:00,662
Listen, what I did was unforgivable.

770
00:43:00,704 --> 00:43:02,704
- Oh, God.
- I'm going to do everything in my power

771
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,291
- to renew my light.
- Mm.

772
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:06,218
Not just for you but for
all the female people

773
00:43:06,259 --> 00:43:08,419
- that I've offended.
- "Renew your light"?

774
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,588
Did you just fucking join the
Church of the Collective?

775
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:13,216
- Maybe.
- You're an idiot.

776
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:15,802
Hey, easy on the religious
persecution, okay, new girl?

777
00:43:15,844 --> 00:43:18,388
Starlight, maybe one day
you can welcome me back

778
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:21,474
into the Seven, but I know
my road is long and hard.

779
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:22,684
Are you serious?

780
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:27,397
There is no fucking way

781
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:29,065
you're coming back.

782
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:31,109
There's no need for language.

783
00:43:31,151 --> 00:43:32,351
All right, enough.

784
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,696
We do not have time for this.

785
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:38,616
Look, I am with you, sister,

786
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:41,411
but first we have to go
get the terrorist, okay?

787
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:47,167
All right, everyone in the tunnels.

788
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:48,888
- Yeah, everyone in the tunnels.
- Not you.

789
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:51,880
Anyone gets eyeballs on the target,

790
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:53,381
he's mine, understood?

791
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:55,592
Go get 'em.

792
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,552
Noir.

793
00:43:57,594 --> 00:43:59,763
All right, you...

794
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:02,687
- need to hang back a bit. Okay?
- Okay.

795
00:44:02,688 --> 00:44:04,352
Still got some work
to do with the ladies,

796
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:05,435
but it's going to be okay.

797
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:06,686
You'll be back in no time.

798
00:44:06,728 --> 00:44:08,730
- Really?
- Sure.

799
00:44:08,772 --> 00:44:10,607
One other thing. You, uh,

800
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,442
you ripped your vest.

801
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:13,735
What?

802
00:44:13,777 --> 00:44:15,612
Your gill is showing.

803
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,530
Cover it up.

804
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:19,741
It's disgusting.

805
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:47,852
Come on.

806
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:49,896
Come on!

807
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:04,536
You okay?

808
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:06,162
Yep.

809
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:07,914
I just need a little rehab.

810
00:45:07,956 --> 00:45:09,374
I'll be fine.

811
00:45:11,418 --> 00:45:13,962
Yeah.

812
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:16,297
I know you will, A-Train.

813
00:46:02,552 --> 00:46:04,762
You got my message.

814
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:08,808
Annie, I...

815
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:33,875
Oh, come on.

816
00:46:33,917 --> 00:46:35,793
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

817
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:37,754
This guy?

818
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,172
Again?

819
00:46:39,214 --> 00:46:41,633
- I did not know...
- Shut it.

820
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:43,394
What, do you got rocks
in your fucking head?

821
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:46,846
Come here.

822
00:46:46,888 --> 00:46:49,015
All right.

823
00:46:49,057 --> 00:46:52,977
I'd like you to do
something for me, okay?

824
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:55,355
Kill him.

825
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:58,316
Uh, n...

826
00:46:58,358 --> 00:46:59,817
Wait.

827
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:01,110
N-N... He...

828
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:03,238
He... He's wanted.

829
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:04,906
Shouldn't we... take him to the police?

830
00:47:04,948 --> 00:47:09,285
Yes, he is. Yes, we should.

831
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:10,954
Kill him.

832
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:12,789
Right now.

833
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,416
Chicks, right, Hughie?

834
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:18,002
Oh, for God's sakes. Come on, it's easy.

835
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:20,129
Hands in the air,

836
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:22,382
like you just don't care.

837
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:24,592
Kill.

838
00:47:25,635 --> 00:47:27,804
Do it.

839
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:36,020
More incentive? Okay.

840
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:39,607
You kill him or I'll
fucking kill you both.

841
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:46,030
Do it.

842
00:47:50,827 --> 00:47:53,246
♪ ...truly call your own ♪

843
00:47:53,288 --> 00:47:58,376
♪ Don't forget your second wind... ♪

844
00:47:58,418 --> 00:47:59,877
Oi. Cunt.

845
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:04,882
William?

846
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:07,051
What a surprise.

847
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:08,845
Hey.

848
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,847
You know, I had a great breakfast

849
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,599
with your wife this morning.

850
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,434
Pancakes.

851
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:17,604
Mmm. Delicious.

852
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:20,732
Yeah?

853
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:23,109
Eat this, motherfucker.

854
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:45,048
Please.

855
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:46,090
Don't.

856
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:58,770
Come on, Hughie. Before
that cunt gets out.

857
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:03,816
Come on.

858
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:22,627
Please.

859
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:26,464
I love you.

860
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:30,802
- I love you, too.
- Hey, guys.

861
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:33,638
Call the foul!

862
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,488
Dad, no!

863
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:57,036
Daddy, you okay?! Dad!

864
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:39,388
Aw.

865
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,270
Can't do your magic little
hand thingy anymore?

866
00:51:41,271 --> 00:51:43,857
How come?

867
00:52:02,662 --> 00:52:04,997
Open your eyes.

868
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:08,209
Open your eyes.

869
00:52:08,251 --> 00:52:11,796
I like to see the light go out.

870
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,845
Fucking yellow bastard.

871
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:48,165
I said he was mine.

872
00:52:55,006 --> 00:52:57,967
You snooze, you lose, Gramps.

873
00:53:28,998 --> 00:53:32,501
I know the news of Compound
V came as a shock to everyone.

874
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,961
As you can imagine,

875
00:53:34,003 --> 00:53:36,422
this has been a very difficult
day for the Vought family.

876
00:53:36,464 --> 00:53:40,801
Our focus now will be
to learn the truth.

877
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:43,638
As I said, we are conducting
a robust investigation

878
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:47,516
into Compound V, but let me be clear:

879
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:50,978
I had no knowledge whatsoever.

880
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,648
We believe it was the work of a small,

881
00:53:53,689 --> 00:53:56,108
disaffected group of scientists

882
00:53:56,150 --> 00:54:00,237
led by former Vought
employee Madelyn Stillwell.

883
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:04,325
But sadly, there are more
important matters at hand.

884
00:54:04,367 --> 00:54:06,160
Everyone at Vought

885
00:54:06,202 --> 00:54:08,579
sends their thoughts and prayers

886
00:54:08,621 --> 00:54:11,874
to those families that
were affected today.

887
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:13,834
Though it is important to acknowledge

888
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:16,003
that this tragic event
could have been far worse,

889
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:19,090
today's attack underscores

890
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:21,717
just how dangerous the threat
of Super terrorists has become.

891
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:25,763
And, at a time like this,
America needs its heroes

892
00:54:25,805 --> 00:54:27,056
more than ever.

893
00:54:27,098 --> 00:54:29,433
We live in a dangerous world.

894
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:33,145
Our brave heroes were already
fighting terrorists overseas,

895
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:36,524
but now, America faces this
war on a different front:

896
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:38,943
right here at home.

897
00:54:38,985 --> 00:54:40,486
These enemies will stop at nothing

898
00:54:40,528 --> 00:54:41,587
to infiltrate our borders

899
00:54:41,629 --> 00:54:43,364
and attack our citizens.

900
00:54:43,406 --> 00:54:47,368
Our superheroes are
the last line of defense.

901
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:50,454
And today, the death toll
would have been much higher

902
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:53,958
had it not been for the brave
actions of our newest hero,

903
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,252
Stormfront, who stopped the terrorist

904
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:59,380
before he could take
more innocent lives.

905
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:27,241
Ladies and gentlemen... Stormfront.

906
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:42,465
Thank you.

907
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:44,133
But we all know who the real heroes

908
00:55:44,175 --> 00:55:45,968
of this group are, right?

909
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:48,929
The people you see behind you,

910
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:51,307
the people who are struggling every day.

911
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:52,850
So let's give them all a hand.

912
00:56:14,205 --> 00:56:16,290
Stormfront, over here.

913
00:56:16,332 --> 00:56:18,709
Stormfront, over here, please!

914
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:36,630
