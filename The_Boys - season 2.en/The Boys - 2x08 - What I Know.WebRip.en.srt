1
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:26,329
Okay, this is insane.

2
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,290
We need more Compound V!

3
00:00:28,332 --> 00:00:30,919
- Absolutely.
- We need more Supes!

4
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:32,561
More Supes! More Supes!

5
00:00:32,587 --> 00:00:34,839
More Supes! More Supes! More Supes!

6
00:00:34,881 --> 00:00:36,090
More Supes! More Supes!

7
00:00:36,091 --> 00:00:37,175
Come with me.

8
00:00:37,217 --> 00:00:38,969
What are you doing here?

9
00:00:40,013 --> 00:00:41,293
But on the bright side,

10
00:00:41,294 --> 00:00:42,472
I'm sleeping in a basement

11
00:00:42,514 --> 00:00:44,775
beneath a pawnshop in East Flatbush.

12
00:00:44,816 --> 00:00:46,019
We never wanted that for you.

13
00:00:46,061 --> 00:00:48,520
We all just have Ryan's
best interests at heart.

14
00:00:48,521 --> 00:00:49,605
I want us to be a family.

15
00:00:49,647 --> 00:00:51,247
They just flew me up and showed me.

16
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:53,489
This house is fake, the
neighbors are fake, you're fake.

17
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,236
No, Ryan!

18
00:00:55,278 --> 00:00:57,158
You have five minutes to
make your opening st...

19
00:01:11,353 --> 00:01:13,838
There's a supervillain
on your school campus.

20
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:15,758
You hear the calls of distress.

21
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,968
You witness a violent
display of superpowers.

22
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:19,053
What do you do?

23
00:01:19,095 --> 00:01:20,930
I'm Sheriff Ed Flanagan,

24
00:01:20,972 --> 00:01:23,600
and I'm here with Homelander
to talk about school safety.

25
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:26,144
On the first report of
an active supervillain,

26
00:01:26,185 --> 00:01:28,689
a hero will immediately
rush to your campus.

27
00:01:28,731 --> 00:01:31,066
But to stay alive in
the moment, remember,

28
00:01:31,108 --> 00:01:34,278
stay calm and follow the law.

29
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,947
Lock all doors and windows.

30
00:01:40,451 --> 00:01:41,660
Arm yourselves.

31
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:44,331
Your teacher should have
an authorized firearm.

32
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:49,544
But use whatever you can.

33
00:01:52,047 --> 00:01:54,049
And wait for a hero.

34
00:01:56,885 --> 00:01:59,138
Unfortunately,

35
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,890
the possibility that you will experience

36
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:03,684
a supervillain attack grows
more likely every day.

37
00:02:03,726 --> 00:02:06,187
But by having an action plan,
you can dramatically increase

38
00:02:06,228 --> 00:02:07,688
your chances of survival.

39
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,941
And survival is all that matters.

40
00:02:13,654 --> 00:02:16,782
- Jody, where's my flag pin?
- How should I know?

41
00:02:16,823 --> 00:02:19,159
Well, I can't go to this
thing without a flag pin.

42
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:21,745
Bob, before he makes any decisions,

43
00:02:21,787 --> 00:02:23,246
- just let me talk to him.
- One,

44
00:02:23,288 --> 00:02:24,998
the president doesn't like you.

45
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,043
He used the word "standoffish".

46
00:02:27,085 --> 00:02:29,087
And, two, he's decided.

47
00:02:29,128 --> 00:02:31,130
He's declaring a national emergency,

48
00:02:31,172 --> 00:02:32,507
bypassing the FDA,

49
00:02:32,548 --> 00:02:35,551
and authorizing Compound V
for use by law enforcement

50
00:02:35,593 --> 00:02:37,433
- and first responders.
- Wait, Robert.

51
00:02:37,434 --> 00:02:39,430
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- I wish I were.

52
00:02:39,472 --> 00:02:41,725
Doses are going for five million a pop.

53
00:02:41,767 --> 00:02:43,352
Pentagon's got a big order in,

54
00:02:43,394 --> 00:02:45,437
and ICE is next in line.

55
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:47,039
You can't release V into the mainstream.

56
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,900
We're talking an avalanche
of Supes; it's suicide.

57
00:02:49,942 --> 00:02:52,528
In one hour, I will be standing
at the memorial service

58
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:55,281
for the fallen heroes
of the House attack,

59
00:02:55,323 --> 00:02:56,783
with my flag pin,

60
00:02:56,825 --> 00:02:59,703
giving my thoughts and
prayers, and pledging

61
00:02:59,744 --> 00:03:01,621
to keep America safe.

62
00:03:01,663 --> 00:03:03,915
The best way to do that
is with Compound V.

63
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,757
Yeah, we know. We were there. Remember?

64
00:03:05,758 --> 00:03:07,627
Covered in my chief of staff's brains.

65
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:09,755
Look, there was no
terrorist. It was Vought.

66
00:03:09,797 --> 00:03:11,841
It's a fucking coup.

67
00:03:11,882 --> 00:03:15,052
- A bunch of their guys died, too.
- To cover their own tracks.

68
00:03:16,846 --> 00:03:18,973
For the record, I agree with you.

69
00:03:19,014 --> 00:03:20,516
And I hate this.

70
00:03:20,558 --> 00:03:22,852
But you've got no proof.

71
00:03:22,893 --> 00:03:24,521
Folks are scared.

72
00:03:24,563 --> 00:03:27,107
If Vought took a shit in
the middle of Fifth Avenue,

73
00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:28,469
they'd throw a ticker-tape parade.

74
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,862
- Here's what we do have, Bob.
- Oh, let me guess.

75
00:03:31,903 --> 00:03:33,655
A tape of me fucking my kids' nanny

76
00:03:33,697 --> 00:03:35,157
at her daughter's quinceaÃ±era?

77
00:03:35,198 --> 00:03:38,119
Release it. Please. I'm begging you.

78
00:03:38,161 --> 00:03:41,873
A plum gig at Fox, and this
shithole in my rearview?

79
00:03:41,914 --> 00:03:42,975
Sounds dreamy.

80
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,959
Okay, what if we got
hard proof? A witness.

81
00:03:45,001 --> 00:03:46,085
Anything.

82
00:03:46,127 --> 00:03:48,421
If you could get Jesus Christ himself,

83
00:03:48,463 --> 00:03:51,674
or maybe Homelander in
front of a camera, sure.

84
00:03:51,716 --> 00:03:53,677
I really am sorry.

85
00:04:30,216 --> 00:04:32,343
I'm nervous about driving in the city.

86
00:04:32,344 --> 00:04:33,384
You'll be okay.

87
00:04:33,385 --> 00:04:35,387
- The plan again?
- Okay,

88
00:04:35,429 --> 00:04:36,973
drive straight to Gen's in Sedona,

89
00:04:37,015 --> 00:04:40,060
cash for gasoline, no hotels.

90
00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:42,062
I don't want to leave you here.

91
00:04:42,103 --> 00:04:43,939
I'll be fine.

92
00:04:47,776 --> 00:04:50,571
The anxious boy? Really?
With the moist handshake?

93
00:04:50,613 --> 00:04:53,032
- Mom, come on.
- Okay. Okay.

94
00:04:53,074 --> 00:04:54,492
Um...

95
00:04:54,534 --> 00:04:55,952
you need a new one.

96
00:04:55,993 --> 00:04:58,246
I...

97
00:05:00,122 --> 00:05:01,541
I'm not gonna wear it.

98
00:05:01,582 --> 00:05:05,420
I don't care if you wear it.
I just want you to have it.

99
00:05:09,132 --> 00:05:11,510
I love you.

100
00:05:11,552 --> 00:05:13,220
I love you, too.

101
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:17,057
You be safe.

102
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:18,517
Okay.

103
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,231
Hey.

104
00:05:23,273 --> 00:05:25,859
- What's going on?
- They've lost their minds.

105
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,946
The RPG releases an
electromagnetic pulse on impact.

106
00:05:29,988 --> 00:05:31,851
Should cut through
Stormfront's plasma bolts.

107
00:05:31,852 --> 00:05:32,882
How sure are you?

108
00:05:32,924 --> 00:05:34,118
It's a guesstimate.

109
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:36,287
So that's Stormfront.

110
00:05:36,328 --> 00:05:38,539
And thanks to Starlight,
we know that Noir

111
00:05:38,581 --> 00:05:39,874
needs only a fuckin' tree nut.

112
00:05:39,915 --> 00:05:40,958
How about A-Train?

113
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,500
Got enough epinephrine here to blow up

114
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:43,541
that motherfucker's heart.

115
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:45,212
Hey, we can't just kill everyone.

116
00:05:45,254 --> 00:05:47,966
That is exactly what we're gonna do.

117
00:05:48,008 --> 00:05:49,050
Listen, you heard Mallory.

118
00:05:49,092 --> 00:05:50,802
She said all we need is another witness.

119
00:05:50,844 --> 00:05:52,554
Wile E. Coyote.

120
00:05:53,513 --> 00:05:55,015
Always chases Roadrunner,

121
00:05:55,056 --> 00:05:57,684
always with an elaborate
plan, always fails.

122
00:05:57,726 --> 00:06:00,145
You know, I always say,
"Why do this, Coyote?

123
00:06:00,186 --> 00:06:03,733
All you need is an AR-15,
and 'meep-meep' no more".

124
00:06:03,774 --> 00:06:05,192
Exactly. See?

125
00:06:05,234 --> 00:06:07,695
We're just gonna shoot
Roadrunner in the fucking head.

126
00:06:07,737 --> 00:06:10,698
That won't stop Vought.
That-that won't stop Compound V.

127
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,033
If you kill these Supes,

128
00:06:12,074 --> 00:06:13,874
then Vought's just gonna
make a thousand more.

129
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,555
Yeah, and we're gonna
top those cunts, too.

130
00:06:15,556 --> 00:06:16,571
Great.

131
00:06:16,613 --> 00:06:19,625
So that's settled. We're just
supervillains now, huh?

132
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,106
Vought attacked the country, Hughie.

133
00:06:21,107 --> 00:06:22,316
Fuck 'em all.

134
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,465
What if I testify?

135
00:06:26,506 --> 00:06:29,009
Escaped convicts don't
have a ton of credibility.

136
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:34,432
No, but maybe I know someone who does.

137
00:06:34,474 --> 00:06:36,643
Give us the day.

138
00:06:38,394 --> 00:06:40,229
Hughie?

139
00:06:40,271 --> 00:06:42,649
See you later.

140
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,736
Officials are still trying to
determine the perpetrator

141
00:06:45,778 --> 00:06:48,113
of the capital attack, the
Department of Homeland Security

142
00:06:48,155 --> 00:06:51,325
has issued a crimson terror alert.

143
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:53,786
In Washington, all
government buildings...

144
00:06:53,827 --> 00:06:56,413
- How's Noir?
- Unresponsive.

145
00:06:56,455 --> 00:06:57,975
They don't think there's brain damage,

146
00:06:57,998 --> 00:06:59,876
but apparently it's hard to tell.

147
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:02,128
So, Noir's a vegetable,

148
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,713
Lamplighter's a charcoal briquette,

149
00:07:03,755 --> 00:07:05,635
Starlight's in the breeze
somewhere, and you're,

150
00:07:05,636 --> 00:07:07,258
- what, fine with it?
- Yes.

151
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,469
Because none of that matters
anymore because of this.

152
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:12,639
So far, no terrorist group
has claimed responsibility.

153
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:14,767
All right, so,

154
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,102
you didn't do this.

155
00:07:16,143 --> 00:07:18,646
I wish I'd killed Vogelbaum.

156
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,815
- But no, it wasn't me.
- Right.

157
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:23,776
And there's no supervillains
on American soil.

158
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,195
- None that we know of.
- And that means...

159
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,741
...it's Edgar.

160
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,369
Maybe. I mean, he is pretty smart,

161
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:33,912
especially for his kind.

162
00:07:33,914 --> 00:07:35,514
...Compound V to members of the military

163
00:07:35,515 --> 00:07:36,581
and law enforcement.

164
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,543
Hey, smile.

165
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,169
This is good news.

166
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:45,800
Yes, there have been sacrifices,
but we are this close

167
00:07:45,842 --> 00:07:48,928
to no more premieres or paparazzi,

168
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:53,558
or screaming fans, or any
of that dancing monkey shit.

169
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,839
We have to make sure that
the right people get the doses,

170
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,064
but it is a whole new world.

171
00:07:59,106 --> 00:08:01,233
What about the wrong people?

172
00:08:01,275 --> 00:08:02,651
Couple of billion of them.

173
00:08:02,693 --> 00:08:05,070
They're not just gonna sit there.

174
00:08:05,112 --> 00:08:07,322
Don't worry, silly.

175
00:08:07,364 --> 00:08:09,742
Frederick had a solution for everything.

176
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:17,167
Okay,

177
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,835
there's something really important

178
00:08:18,877 --> 00:08:20,503
that I've been meaning to ask you.

179
00:08:21,546 --> 00:08:24,382
Last I checked, you
are not 57 years old,

180
00:08:24,424 --> 00:08:29,096
so, come on, why is it
always, always Billy Joel?

181
00:08:29,138 --> 00:08:31,057
I'm 57 on the inside.

182
00:08:31,098 --> 00:08:32,683
No, really. Please.

183
00:08:34,685 --> 00:08:36,520
It was just the music
in my house growing up.

184
00:08:36,562 --> 00:08:38,682
You know, I did some somersaults
to "You May Be Right"

185
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:42,235
that were pretty thrilling to watch.

186
00:08:42,277 --> 00:08:46,114
âª Only the good die young... âª

187
00:08:46,156 --> 00:08:49,034
Butcher is right, you know.

188
00:08:49,076 --> 00:08:52,370
We've already tried to take
Vought down the right way.

189
00:08:52,412 --> 00:08:54,791
This isn't gonna work; this is
not gonna stop Compound V

190
00:08:54,832 --> 00:08:57,710
- from getting out there.
- So it's hopeless?

191
00:08:57,752 --> 00:09:00,838
Just kill 'em all, let God sort 'em out?

192
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,048
I mean...

193
00:09:04,092 --> 00:09:06,636
Then why are you even helping me?

194
00:09:08,262 --> 00:09:10,307
Why did you save me at the Tower?

195
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,267
They were... they were gonna hurt you.

196
00:09:12,309 --> 00:09:14,561
Yeah, but, Hughie, you could
have gotten yourself killed.

197
00:09:14,603 --> 00:09:16,980
I mean, after the way
that I treated you,

198
00:09:17,022 --> 00:09:19,900
you had every reason to give up on me.

199
00:09:19,942 --> 00:09:22,236
So why didn't you?

200
00:09:22,277 --> 00:09:23,738
âª Only the good die young... âª

201
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:28,326
I just... would never.

202
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:32,205
That's why I'm helping.

203
00:09:43,926 --> 00:09:47,304
You were stupid to text.

204
00:09:47,346 --> 00:09:50,516
Everyone's looking for you.

205
00:09:50,558 --> 00:09:52,394
Where's Elena?

206
00:09:52,435 --> 00:09:54,104
This is the guy?

207
00:09:56,064 --> 00:09:58,150
Uh, I'm sorry...

208
00:09:59,442 --> 00:10:00,569
Hi. Hughie.

209
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,363
He's even more of a
twink than in the photo.

210
00:10:05,198 --> 00:10:07,034
I could split that shit
like dry firewood.

211
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,371
Big fan.

212
00:10:10,413 --> 00:10:12,707
I need to ask you something.

213
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,585
It's a lot.

214
00:10:16,794 --> 00:10:20,339
- I need you to testify.
- Testify?

215
00:10:20,381 --> 00:10:22,342
On the record.

216
00:10:22,384 --> 00:10:25,304
Against Vought, against Homelander,

217
00:10:25,345 --> 00:10:27,097
Stormfront, everything.

218
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:28,974
Why would I do that?

219
00:10:29,016 --> 00:10:33,020
Because things are really bad, and...

220
00:10:34,146 --> 00:10:36,232
...you're our last chance.

221
00:10:36,274 --> 00:10:38,443
- Pass.
- Look, I get

222
00:10:38,484 --> 00:10:40,987
- that it's dangerous.
- It's suicide.

223
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:42,322
But that's not the reason.

224
00:10:42,363 --> 00:10:44,073
Well, then, what is?

225
00:10:45,074 --> 00:10:46,743
I'm tired.

226
00:10:47,785 --> 00:10:49,997
We're all tired.

227
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,999
But they're hurting people.

228
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,281
And sooner or later, they're
gonna hurt someone you love.

229
00:10:54,282 --> 00:10:55,700
Am I talking to you?

230
00:10:57,046 --> 00:10:58,589
Look.

231
00:11:01,717 --> 00:11:07,641
I get that it's easier to just disappear

232
00:11:07,682 --> 00:11:08,892
inside of yourself.

233
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:11,144
Trust me, it's all I want to do.

234
00:11:11,186 --> 00:11:12,979
But we can't, Maeve.

235
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:15,440
We can't.

236
00:11:15,482 --> 00:11:17,317
This is a war now,

237
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:19,737
- and we...
- Shut the fuck up.

238
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,781
Christ, you...

239
00:11:21,822 --> 00:11:24,242
Haven't I done enough for you?

240
00:11:27,536 --> 00:11:30,122
Didn't I save your fucking life?

241
00:11:32,918 --> 00:11:36,296
It doesn't matter what
we do, nothing changes.

242
00:11:40,968 --> 00:11:45,722
Nothing ever changes or gets better.

243
00:11:49,936 --> 00:11:51,938
And I'm tired.

244
00:11:53,064 --> 00:11:55,650
Just leave.

245
00:11:57,485 --> 00:11:59,946
Go! Take your fucking twink

246
00:11:59,988 --> 00:12:02,533
and get the fuck out of here!

247
00:12:02,574 --> 00:12:05,619
Okay.

248
00:12:05,661 --> 00:12:07,663
Come on.

249
00:12:22,262 --> 00:12:24,055
Monsieur Charcuter, we need you.

250
00:12:24,097 --> 00:12:25,307
Now.

251
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:30,395
He said he lives under a
pawnshop in East Flatbush!

252
00:12:30,437 --> 00:12:32,440
- He has to be here.
- Hey. Let her in.

253
00:12:32,481 --> 00:12:35,234
Fucking help me... Billy.

254
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:38,487
They took him.

255
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:39,739
They have Ryan.

256
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,449
Who's got him?

257
00:12:45,162 --> 00:12:47,122
I appreciate you coming
all this way, Stan.

258
00:12:47,164 --> 00:12:50,208
Well, I can't exactly be seen

259
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,628
with you at the Tower now, can I?

260
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,130
- Fresca?
- No.

261
00:12:55,172 --> 00:12:56,840
Thank you. Awful stuff.

262
00:12:59,176 --> 00:13:02,138
So, you've had a chance
to look over our proposal?

263
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,391
He publicly confessed to
a sexual assault, Alastair.

264
00:13:05,393 --> 00:13:06,953
And we've made a substantial investment

265
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:08,644
in the Deep's rehabilitation.

266
00:13:08,686 --> 00:13:12,190
Our internal research bureau
shows an impressive Q rating.

267
00:13:12,231 --> 00:13:17,071
He's an asset to Vought
in these troubled times.

268
00:13:17,112 --> 00:13:20,449
Oh. What sort of commission is
the Church getting these days?

269
00:13:20,491 --> 00:13:22,659
40%? 50?

270
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,453
Sounds like you're
open to reinstatement.

271
00:13:24,495 --> 00:13:25,788
That's fantastic.

272
00:13:27,831 --> 00:13:29,250
What about A-Train?

273
00:13:29,292 --> 00:13:32,504
You do need a speedster,
since Shockwave exploded.

274
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:33,713
Harder sell.

275
00:13:33,755 --> 00:13:36,716
One has-been back is redemption.

276
00:13:36,758 --> 00:13:39,219
Two is weakness.

277
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,054
Stormfront has problems with him.

278
00:13:41,096 --> 00:13:44,475
And at the moment,
I have to indulge her.

279
00:13:44,517 --> 00:13:47,061
What's her problem with A-Train?

280
00:13:47,103 --> 00:13:50,272
I understand that she was
among your grandfather's

281
00:13:50,314 --> 00:13:54,360
first followers back when
the Collective was a start-up.

282
00:13:56,153 --> 00:13:58,407
I can neither confirm nor deny that.

283
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:04,871
Then your internal research
bureau knows exactly

284
00:14:04,913 --> 00:14:07,541
what Stormfront's
problem is with A-Train.

285
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:10,836
Deep is still a win.

286
00:14:10,877 --> 00:14:12,880
Shall I have Business Affairs reach out?

287
00:14:12,922 --> 00:14:14,924
- Please do.
- Let me walk you out.

288
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,274
Sons of bitches.

289
00:14:32,443 --> 00:14:34,611
Okay, yeah.

290
00:14:34,653 --> 00:14:38,073
VoilÃ . Uh, jambon-beurre.

291
00:14:38,115 --> 00:14:40,034
Simple, but it's the
ingredients, you know?

292
00:14:40,076 --> 00:14:41,876
- Thank you.
- Diet Coke

293
00:14:41,877 --> 00:14:43,663
with Lime, right?

294
00:14:43,705 --> 00:14:46,291
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

295
00:14:46,332 --> 00:14:47,709
We've heard a lot about you.

296
00:14:49,586 --> 00:14:52,672
Uh, I'm sorry, I-I wish

297
00:14:52,714 --> 00:14:54,257
I could say the same.

298
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:56,677
Uh, you all close with Billy?

299
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:58,596
Yeah.

300
00:14:58,637 --> 00:15:01,223
I mean... sure.

301
00:15:01,265 --> 00:15:04,018
- Why the hesitation?
- Well...

302
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:07,771
Let's just say he ain't really
close to a lot of people.

303
00:15:07,813 --> 00:15:10,817
You know? Well, except you, of course.

304
00:15:10,859 --> 00:15:12,819
I'm close to him.

305
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:14,433
- I am.
- All right, all right, lads,

306
00:15:14,434 --> 00:15:15,655
let's give her some air, eh?

307
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:17,324
Yeah.

308
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:20,785
So, Ryan ain't on any
of their social media,

309
00:15:20,827 --> 00:15:23,623
which is good on one hand,
but it don't help us none.

310
00:15:23,664 --> 00:15:25,708
- So, you think he's in the Tower?
- Not sure.

311
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,877
You stay here.

312
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:31,422
Rest up. I'm gonna go
do a little digging.

313
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:33,883
Hey, Billy.

314
00:15:35,676 --> 00:15:37,470
I'm sorry, okay?

315
00:15:37,512 --> 00:15:39,097
I have no right to ask you to help me

316
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,516
after what I said to you, but...

317
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:43,852
Look, don't you worry, all right?

318
00:15:43,894 --> 00:15:46,104
I will find your son.

319
00:15:50,651 --> 00:15:52,487
Thank you.

320
00:15:58,409 --> 00:16:00,411
Fuck off, you lot.

321
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,253
What is it, Samantha?

322
00:16:07,294 --> 00:16:09,547
Mr. Edgar, normally,

323
00:16:09,588 --> 00:16:11,348
I wouldn't put this through,
but the man says

324
00:16:11,349 --> 00:16:13,092
it's life or death, and you'd know him.

325
00:16:13,133 --> 00:16:14,552
What's his name?

326
00:16:14,593 --> 00:16:16,095
William Butcher.

327
00:16:18,222 --> 00:16:19,765
Hi, hi.

328
00:16:19,807 --> 00:16:21,560
We've been having a
super fun time in here.

329
00:16:21,601 --> 00:16:24,354
I've just been googling all the
names of the cats in "Cats".

330
00:16:24,396 --> 00:16:26,648
Can you believe Ryan
has never seen "Cats"?

331
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,483
What happened to your hair?

332
00:16:28,525 --> 00:16:30,485
- Oh, nothing.
- Hey, buddy.

333
00:16:30,504 --> 00:16:31,944
Sorry we had to leave you all alone.

334
00:16:31,945 --> 00:16:34,531
Dad's work can sometimes
get pretty crazy.

335
00:16:34,573 --> 00:16:36,367
He hasn't been alone.

336
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:38,786
I've been here. I got him
all these dipping sauces.

337
00:16:38,828 --> 00:16:41,163
You didn't want to play
"Vought Tournament of Heroes"?

338
00:16:41,205 --> 00:16:42,415
I'm the main guy.

339
00:16:42,456 --> 00:16:44,667
I was working on my states.

340
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:47,962
- Uh, states?
- Well, yeah, I write down all 50 states

341
00:16:48,004 --> 00:16:51,341
as fast as I can in
either alphabetical order

342
00:16:51,383 --> 00:16:52,968
or geographical order.

343
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,053
You're giving yourself homework?

344
00:16:55,095 --> 00:16:57,723
Well, Mom says that
learning is a gift, so...

345
00:16:57,764 --> 00:17:00,726
Mm-hmm. That mom of yours,

346
00:17:00,767 --> 00:17:03,854
she sure does have
some cute little sayings.

347
00:17:05,857 --> 00:17:08,484
Do you think maybe I could call her?

348
00:17:09,736 --> 00:17:10,820
Uh...

349
00:17:14,824 --> 00:17:16,784
Hey, Ryan.

350
00:17:16,826 --> 00:17:18,036
Ugh.

351
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:22,833
I get it. I would feel lonely,
too, if I was cooped up

352
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,712
all day by myself in this
West Elm Death Star.

353
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,549
- Mm-hmm.
- How about

354
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,551
we take a field trip?

355
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,387
What do you say, Dad?

356
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:37,766
Welcome to Planet Vought.

357
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,893
Have a super day.

358
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:44,898
Let's give a warm hero's welcome

359
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,419
to Kashden, who's turning five today.

360
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,902
Welcome to Planet Vought.

361
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:49,362
Would you like to try our new

362
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:52,531
Brave Maeve Rainbow Veggie Burger?

363
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:54,492
Holy shit.

364
00:17:59,497 --> 00:18:01,541
There you go, Maestro.

365
00:18:04,086 --> 00:18:06,088
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Yeah.

366
00:18:06,129 --> 00:18:08,090
Hey.

367
00:18:08,131 --> 00:18:10,509
Wait until you try the
Big Homey with bacon.

368
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,344
It's so good.

369
00:18:12,386 --> 00:18:15,080
And-and the, uh, and
the Mocha Noir Shake?

370
00:18:15,122 --> 00:18:16,163
It's amazing.

371
00:18:16,164 --> 00:18:18,284
And it won't be lumpy like your mom's.

372
00:18:18,326 --> 00:18:19,660
Homelander?

373
00:18:19,702 --> 00:18:21,187
Hey.

374
00:18:21,229 --> 00:18:24,732
- Can I get a selfie?
- Ask the boss.

375
00:18:24,774 --> 00:18:26,359
Kidding. Of course you can.

376
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:29,112
- Of course you can.
- Stormfront? I-I love you.

377
00:18:29,153 --> 00:18:30,864
- Can I get a self... a selfie?
- Oh, sure.

378
00:18:30,906 --> 00:18:32,182
One at a time.

379
00:18:32,225 --> 00:18:33,825
- Homelander.
- Kids first.

380
00:18:33,826 --> 00:18:34,826
I'm a huge fan.

381
00:18:34,827 --> 00:18:36,427
- Can I get a picture?
- It's Homelander!

382
00:18:36,428 --> 00:18:38,121
- All right. Hey!
- I love you! Homelander!

383
00:18:38,122 --> 00:18:40,082
- Homelander!
- Hey, guys...

384
00:18:43,752 --> 00:18:46,214
I want to go home.

385
00:18:49,884 --> 00:18:52,387
Hey. You okay?

386
00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:53,763
I want my mom.

387
00:18:53,805 --> 00:18:57,183
Okay, I got you. I got you.

388
00:18:57,225 --> 00:18:59,395
Thank you, everyone. Excuse me.

389
00:18:59,437 --> 00:19:02,523
Thank you. Excuse me. Excuse me.

390
00:19:02,565 --> 00:19:05,735
Stay back, please. Please,
please, please. Just stay back.

391
00:19:05,776 --> 00:19:07,987
Stay back. Thank you.

392
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,301
- New bling?
- Mm-hmm.

393
00:19:14,302 --> 00:19:16,121
Donna got it for me.

394
00:19:16,163 --> 00:19:18,415
Pretty sure she got it at Duane Reade.

395
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,462
Oh, gosh. Moms.

396
00:19:23,503 --> 00:19:28,134
The gift that keeps on giving, forever.

397
00:19:30,887 --> 00:19:32,388
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

398
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,891
Wh... No, it's-it's fine.

399
00:19:34,932 --> 00:19:37,310
No, no. I'm an asshole
for bitching about my mom

400
00:19:37,351 --> 00:19:39,187
when yours is...

401
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,983
My mom's not dead.

402
00:19:43,025 --> 00:19:44,818
She's not?

403
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,987
Oh, it's just, you never
mentioned her, so...

404
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:49,156
She left when I was six.

405
00:19:49,198 --> 00:19:52,785
Oh, wow. Shit.

406
00:19:52,826 --> 00:19:54,453
I'm really sorry.

407
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:59,876
That's where Billy Joel comes from.

408
00:19:59,918 --> 00:20:02,545
She and I, we used to
have these dance parties.

409
00:20:02,587 --> 00:20:04,964
She was, she was fun.

410
00:20:05,006 --> 00:20:08,134
She made awesome Seven
costumes for Halloween.

411
00:20:08,176 --> 00:20:14,099
And, uh, then one day, she just
left and never called again.

412
00:20:14,141 --> 00:20:16,811
Not even a card.

413
00:20:16,852 --> 00:20:18,813
You know, it was like
some silent alarm went off

414
00:20:18,854 --> 00:20:21,482
and she was like, "Well...

415
00:20:21,524 --> 00:20:24,360
fuck them, time to go".

416
00:20:24,401 --> 00:20:26,696
No, I'm sure that that's not it.

417
00:20:26,738 --> 00:20:28,615
What would you call it?

418
00:20:32,327 --> 00:20:35,247
I guess that's why I always
just kind of hang in there,

419
00:20:35,288 --> 00:20:38,917
no matter how bad it gets.

420
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:41,212
'Cause I...

421
00:20:41,254 --> 00:20:43,589
I-I don't want to be like her.

422
00:20:45,633 --> 00:20:49,554
That's kind of clingy
and pathetic, isn't it?

423
00:20:49,595 --> 00:20:51,639
No. No.

424
00:20:51,681 --> 00:20:53,558
It isn't.

425
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:55,185
At all.

426
00:20:57,563 --> 00:20:59,314
What's up, shitbirds?

427
00:20:59,356 --> 00:21:01,036
Jesus Christ!

428
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:06,321
What the fuck?! What the fuck?!

429
00:21:06,363 --> 00:21:08,156
- How did you find us?!
- Please.

430
00:21:08,198 --> 00:21:10,039
I can cover the boroughs
in, like, three hours.

431
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,290
I went looking, that's all.

432
00:21:11,331 --> 00:21:13,121
I'm surprised your heart can take it.

433
00:21:13,162 --> 00:21:15,522
My heart is just fine. Take a
step closer and I'll show you.

434
00:21:15,564 --> 00:21:16,857
Hey, I saved your life,

435
00:21:16,898 --> 00:21:18,918
asshole. And now you're coming after us?

436
00:21:24,466 --> 00:21:25,676
We're even now, bitch.

437
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:32,600
Holy shit!

438
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:34,518
Is this true?

439
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,640
Everything makes a little
more sense now, doesn't it?

440
00:21:36,641 --> 00:21:37,661
Where did you get this?

441
00:21:37,662 --> 00:21:39,608
I didn't get it. Okay? I was never here.

442
00:21:39,649 --> 00:21:41,860
You got that shit on your own. Yeah?

443
00:21:41,902 --> 00:21:43,695
But wh... why-why are you doing this?

444
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:45,030
'Cause I want back in.

445
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:47,532
So, I need her gone.

446
00:21:47,574 --> 00:21:49,743
Fuck that Nazi bitch.

447
00:22:16,104 --> 00:22:18,357
Would you ask Mario if he could whip up

448
00:22:18,398 --> 00:22:21,152
some of those GruyÃ¨re puffs?

449
00:22:21,194 --> 00:22:23,571
Would you like an order?
They're worth the cheat day.

450
00:22:23,613 --> 00:22:28,076
I assume you got a man out
there, with a clean shot?

451
00:22:28,117 --> 00:22:29,744
More than one.

452
00:22:29,786 --> 00:22:31,426
Then I'll skip the
fucking hors d'oeuvres,

453
00:22:31,427 --> 00:22:34,082
if you don't mind, and we'll
just cut straight to it, yeah?

454
00:22:34,123 --> 00:22:36,126
You mentioned on the
phone that you could help

455
00:22:36,168 --> 00:22:38,045
with Homelander's son.

456
00:22:38,087 --> 00:22:41,215
I must say, I'm not sure what you mean.

457
00:22:41,256 --> 00:22:44,259
That boy is your only
possible contingency

458
00:22:44,301 --> 00:22:46,261
against Homelander.

459
00:22:46,303 --> 00:22:49,432
Now, that contingency don't work

460
00:22:49,474 --> 00:22:52,060
if they're off playing
Ward and the Beav.

461
00:22:53,228 --> 00:22:54,354
I can fix that.

462
00:22:58,149 --> 00:22:59,150
Thank you, Alvin.

463
00:23:00,902 --> 00:23:02,737
Homelander's a friend.

464
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:04,824
Why would I betray him?

465
00:23:04,865 --> 00:23:07,576
Because you're a ruthless bastard.

466
00:23:10,413 --> 00:23:11,455
That's hurtful.

467
00:23:11,497 --> 00:23:13,040
You turned a racist piece of shite

468
00:23:13,082 --> 00:23:15,042
into America's sweetheart.

469
00:23:15,084 --> 00:23:17,294
What word would you use?

470
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,181
Stormfront's good at
making people angry.

471
00:23:28,223 --> 00:23:30,892
Angry people want Compound V.

472
00:23:30,934 --> 00:23:33,479
Compound V raises our stock price.

473
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:36,024
Look, I'd have preferred
V remained a secret,

474
00:23:36,065 --> 00:23:38,985
but we play with the cards we're dealt.

475
00:23:39,027 --> 00:23:42,321
It's not ruthless,
it's prices per share.

476
00:23:42,363 --> 00:23:43,948
That's all.

477
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,952
Maybe you should take a
look in the mirror, mate.

478
00:23:46,994 --> 00:23:49,079
'Cause that bitch should bother you.

479
00:23:49,121 --> 00:23:51,623
Of course she does.

480
00:23:51,665 --> 00:23:54,501
But it's not about me.

481
00:23:54,543 --> 00:23:56,420
I can't lash out

482
00:23:56,462 --> 00:24:00,299
like some raging, entitled maniac.

483
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,385
That's a white man's luxury.

484
00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:07,307
So, it's just business, then, eh?

485
00:24:07,348 --> 00:24:10,226
When, Mr. Butcher, in history,

486
00:24:10,268 --> 00:24:13,313
has it ever been about
anything different?

487
00:24:14,439 --> 00:24:16,150
And what makes you think

488
00:24:16,192 --> 00:24:19,320
that you can control that racist bitch?

489
00:24:19,361 --> 00:24:22,740
Look, I've got to get across town...

490
00:24:22,782 --> 00:24:25,117
Look, I can get the boy away
from Homelander, all right?

491
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:26,827
How?

492
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,872
That's my business.

493
00:24:31,249 --> 00:24:34,836
When I got him, I'll call your people,

494
00:24:34,878 --> 00:24:36,421
they zero in on this cell signal,

495
00:24:36,463 --> 00:24:38,590
and then come and scoop him up.

496
00:24:38,632 --> 00:24:40,759
And then you do a better fucking job

497
00:24:40,801 --> 00:24:42,385
of hiding him this time, yeah?

498
00:24:44,262 --> 00:24:45,890
You have my word.

499
00:24:45,932 --> 00:24:47,934
I will get Rebecca and
Ryan somewhere safe.

500
00:24:47,975 --> 00:24:49,352
No.

501
00:24:49,393 --> 00:24:51,813
Not Becca. Becca stays with me.

502
00:24:51,854 --> 00:24:53,898
But that's the whole point.

503
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,192
That he's raised by his mother.

504
00:24:56,234 --> 00:24:57,527
Find him a new fucking mum.

505
00:24:57,568 --> 00:25:00,322
I'm taking my wife
back. That's the deal.

506
00:25:00,364 --> 00:25:03,992
And what happens when Rebecca
shows up on my doorstep,

507
00:25:04,034 --> 00:25:06,912
begging to be reunited with her boy?

508
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:12,292
You say it's the only way

509
00:25:12,334 --> 00:25:15,338
you can guarantee Ryan's
protection from Homelander.

510
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,299
'Cause as you know,

511
00:25:18,341 --> 00:25:21,678
a mother will do anything

512
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:23,930
to protect her son.

513
00:25:24,973 --> 00:25:27,685
And you call me a ruthless bastard.

514
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:30,312
You tell me where he is...

515
00:25:31,689 --> 00:25:33,232
...and I'll do the rest.

516
00:25:48,707 --> 00:25:49,875
Where's Ryan?

517
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:52,252
He's, um, he's inside.

518
00:25:52,294 --> 00:25:53,795
He doesn't want to talk.

519
00:25:53,837 --> 00:25:55,922
- So, go in anyway.
- No, no, no, no. I've tried.

520
00:25:55,964 --> 00:25:58,050
He... he wants to be left alone.

521
00:25:58,092 --> 00:26:00,094
You are the strongest man in the world,

522
00:26:00,136 --> 00:26:03,347
and you're scared of a little boy.

523
00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:04,807
He's your blood.

524
00:26:04,849 --> 00:26:07,476
Just talk to him.

525
00:26:07,518 --> 00:26:09,520
Be the man I know you are.

526
00:26:11,315 --> 00:26:14,359
New York. North Carolina.

527
00:26:14,401 --> 00:26:17,988
North Dakota. Ohio.

528
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:22,242
Oklahoma. Oregon.

529
00:26:24,036 --> 00:26:26,456
I'm sorry.

530
00:26:26,497 --> 00:26:28,249
No, no, no, no. Buddy,

531
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:29,667
don't you be sorry.

532
00:26:29,709 --> 00:26:31,419
I... I should've known better.

533
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,845
There were just... so many people.

534
00:26:39,887 --> 00:26:41,889
Yeah, there was.

535
00:26:51,232 --> 00:26:54,361
You know, I remember the
first time I was in a crowd.

536
00:26:54,402 --> 00:26:56,404
Probably didn't bother you.

537
00:26:56,446 --> 00:26:58,198
I was terrified.

538
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,951
All these people staring at me

539
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,994
and reaching out, trying to grab me,

540
00:27:03,036 --> 00:27:04,621
and egging me on to use my powers.

541
00:27:04,663 --> 00:27:08,751
I just... I felt like I was... drowning.

542
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,587
Well, what'd you do?

543
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:13,881
Well, I took off.

544
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:17,802
I flew away.

545
00:27:17,843 --> 00:27:20,721
They found me 80 miles down the I-9.

546
00:27:20,763 --> 00:27:22,640
Crying my little eyes out.

547
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:29,231
You? Cry?

548
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,444
Yes.

549
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:42,453
But I'm a man, so, not
in a long while. But...

550
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:45,164
who knows, maybe, uh...

551
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:47,834
maybe next time, you'll fly away.

552
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:50,878
Maybe... with me.

553
00:27:54,258 --> 00:27:56,844
Look...

554
00:27:56,885 --> 00:27:59,305
I know you want me to be like you.

555
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:01,098
But, Dad, I'm not.

556
00:28:05,477 --> 00:28:09,316
Son...

557
00:28:09,357 --> 00:28:13,236
I didn't just wake up one
day and fly out the door.

558
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:16,031
That's not how it works. I had to learn.

559
00:28:16,072 --> 00:28:18,033
Only I didn't have anyone to teach me,

560
00:28:18,074 --> 00:28:21,287
'cause the doctors that... um...

561
00:28:21,329 --> 00:28:24,373
The people that raised me,

562
00:28:24,415 --> 00:28:26,834
uh, were scared of me,

563
00:28:26,876 --> 00:28:28,836
so they kept their distance.

564
00:28:28,878 --> 00:28:32,131
And I had to figure it
all out by myself, see?

565
00:28:32,173 --> 00:28:34,843
Well, you-you don't have
to go through any of that.

566
00:28:34,885 --> 00:28:36,845
I'll teach you.

567
00:28:36,887 --> 00:28:38,638
Really?

568
00:28:40,557 --> 00:28:42,100
I love you.

569
00:29:03,331 --> 00:29:05,209
Hey, did you find anything?

570
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,212
They got him in a cabin up in Rochester.

571
00:29:08,253 --> 00:29:11,340
- What?
- I mean... Becca!

572
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:13,926
She's great. We-we talked earlier.

573
00:29:13,967 --> 00:29:15,886
And, um, she's-she's
really great. She's...

574
00:29:15,928 --> 00:29:18,210
- You're really... you're great.
- All right, easy, tiger.

575
00:29:18,211 --> 00:29:20,058
How'd you get on? I
guess you got fuck all?

576
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,478
No witnesses. But we
definitely found fuck all.

577
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,022
I'm not sure I'm using that
term properly, but, uh...

578
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:28,066
here.

579
00:29:29,275 --> 00:29:32,112
Fuck me.

580
00:29:32,153 --> 00:29:33,989
This is a jackpot.

581
00:29:34,031 --> 00:29:36,700
Well done, you two.

582
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:38,911
This'll do nicely.

583
00:29:38,953 --> 00:29:40,496
All right, listen up, you lot.

584
00:29:40,538 --> 00:29:42,178
Getting the kid back,
it ain't your fight,

585
00:29:42,219 --> 00:29:43,819
and I ain't gonna ask you to come along.

586
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,710
Lick my big black balls, Butcher.

587
00:29:46,753 --> 00:29:47,921
Sorry, Becca.

588
00:29:47,963 --> 00:29:49,506
You done asked us to lie,

589
00:29:49,548 --> 00:29:53,051
spy, do all kinds of
fucked up shit for you.

590
00:29:53,093 --> 00:29:55,345
Now we finally get a chance
to do something good,

591
00:29:55,387 --> 00:29:57,389
and you think we're gonna
take a pass on that?

592
00:29:57,431 --> 00:29:58,974
We're in.

593
00:29:59,015 --> 00:30:00,642
Of course we're in.

594
00:30:02,478 --> 00:30:03,980
All right.

595
00:30:05,189 --> 00:30:06,566
Let's get a shift on.

596
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,307
What?

597
00:30:37,348 --> 00:30:40,018
You remember the range at Fort Bragg?

598
00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:42,312
I was a better shot than you.

599
00:30:42,353 --> 00:30:45,941
Well, you had a bloody
good teacher, didn't you?

600
00:30:45,983 --> 00:30:48,360
I like your friends.

601
00:30:48,402 --> 00:30:50,821
Especially Hughie. He's, uh...

602
00:30:50,863 --> 00:30:52,239
He's good for you.

603
00:30:52,281 --> 00:30:56,827
Look, Becca... you ain't coming with us.

604
00:30:56,869 --> 00:30:58,287
Bullshit.

605
00:30:58,329 --> 00:31:00,170
Ryan doesn't know you,
he'll never come to you.

606
00:31:00,212 --> 00:31:02,297
It's too dangerous, and I
ain't gonna lose you again.

607
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:04,294
He's my son, and I'm coming.

608
00:31:13,596 --> 00:31:16,474
I need you to promise me something.

609
00:31:16,516 --> 00:31:19,477
I need you to promise me
that you will save him

610
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,854
no matter what and you
will get him back to me.

611
00:31:24,023 --> 00:31:25,983
Yeah. Of course.

612
00:31:26,025 --> 00:31:27,746
You realize this isn't
just about me, right?

613
00:31:27,747 --> 00:31:29,446
Like, h-he can't grow
up like Homelander.

614
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:31,323
You have to think of all of the people

615
00:31:31,365 --> 00:31:34,201
out there that he would...

616
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:39,915
Swear to me, then.

617
00:31:39,957 --> 00:31:41,960
You swear to me on your brother's soul.

618
00:31:47,257 --> 00:31:49,425
I swear to you.

619
00:31:49,467 --> 00:31:52,887
I swear to you on Lenny's soul.

620
00:31:55,848 --> 00:31:58,852
- Okay. Okay.
- All right.

621
00:32:30,386 --> 00:32:32,388
I can use your help loading the car.

622
00:32:39,646 --> 00:32:42,357
What if it happens again?

623
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,818
When I see Stormfront...

624
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,486
Stormfront...

625
00:32:46,528 --> 00:32:49,156
...what if I freeze?

626
00:32:51,491 --> 00:32:53,660
"Freeze", yes?

627
00:32:53,702 --> 00:32:55,330
Sorry, I'm still learning.

628
00:32:57,373 --> 00:32:58,583
Look.

629
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:04,714
If there's one thing I know,

630
00:33:04,756 --> 00:33:08,719
it's that you can take care of yourself.

631
00:33:08,761 --> 00:33:14,391
So when the time comes,
you'll know what to do.

632
00:33:19,188 --> 00:33:20,397
Let's go.

633
00:33:26,112 --> 00:33:27,906
Keep going. You got it.

634
00:33:27,947 --> 00:33:29,866
That's it, don't give up.

635
00:33:29,908 --> 00:33:32,202
That's it, that's it. Keep going.

636
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:36,039
Little more, little more, you got it.

637
00:33:40,169 --> 00:33:41,545
Oh... hey, that's okay.

638
00:33:41,587 --> 00:33:44,006
You'll get it, you'll get it. Um...

639
00:33:46,342 --> 00:33:47,468
I know what.

640
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:50,096
Um, imagine, um...

641
00:33:50,137 --> 00:33:54,017
Well, sometimes it helps to
imagine someone you hate. Okay?

642
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:56,478
So, try that.

643
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,230
But at home,

644
00:33:58,271 --> 00:34:00,816
when I say "hate", I have to
put a quarter in the swear jar.

645
00:34:00,857 --> 00:34:02,234
Well, there's no swear jar here.

646
00:34:02,275 --> 00:34:05,947
So, you can hate away.

647
00:34:05,988 --> 00:34:07,657
But I don't really hate anyone.

648
00:34:07,699 --> 00:34:09,200
Aw, well,

649
00:34:09,242 --> 00:34:11,869
that is very sweet, Ryan.

650
00:34:11,911 --> 00:34:15,081
But it's not something we can afford.

651
00:34:15,123 --> 00:34:16,916
We're under attack.

652
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:18,751
We are?

653
00:34:18,793 --> 00:34:22,840
Bad guys want to hurt us just
'cause of what we look like.

654
00:34:22,881 --> 00:34:24,842
They want to wipe us from this Earth,

655
00:34:24,883 --> 00:34:27,886
just because of the color of our skin.

656
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:31,765
Really?

657
00:34:31,807 --> 00:34:35,019
It's called white genocide.

658
00:34:35,061 --> 00:34:39,357
And we're gonna need people
like you to protect our kind.

659
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:41,693
Hmm. All right.

660
00:34:41,735 --> 00:34:43,403
So, let's try again.

661
00:34:43,445 --> 00:34:45,405
Go for it. Imagine, uh...

662
00:34:45,447 --> 00:34:47,115
You got to be fucking kidding me!

663
00:34:49,493 --> 00:34:50,953
What?

664
00:34:59,003 --> 00:35:03,048
Are you sure this'll work?

665
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:04,468
Don't worry, it will work.

666
00:35:04,509 --> 00:35:06,261
This is nothing compared to the raves

667
00:35:06,303 --> 00:35:08,013
I used to set up in Algiers.

668
00:35:08,054 --> 00:35:09,639
Do you dance?

669
00:35:09,681 --> 00:35:11,099
Of course I dance.

670
00:35:11,141 --> 00:35:12,976
What is the point of
life without dancing?

671
00:35:16,313 --> 00:35:18,107
She's on the move.

672
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:23,863
âª One, two, three, four... âª

673
00:35:23,905 --> 00:35:25,698
I see her, Frenchie. We got to go now.

674
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,517
- You close?
- Un moment, mon ami.

675
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:29,751
- Holy shit. It just broke.
- Stunning news coming out of Vought Tower

676
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,871
in New York City, concerning Stormfront

677
00:35:31,913 --> 00:35:35,000
and alleged Nazi ties.

678
00:35:35,042 --> 00:35:36,794
Stormfront may be 100 years old.

679
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:40,923
What's even more incredible,
we have authenticated photos

680
00:35:40,964 --> 00:35:43,717
showing Stormfront
with Nazi High Command,

681
00:35:43,759 --> 00:35:46,178
including Goebbels and GÃ¶ring.

682
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:50,016
Based on the photos, it is now
believed that she was the wife

683
00:35:50,058 --> 00:35:52,393
of Frederick Vought, who
was of course the founder

684
00:35:52,435 --> 00:35:53,895
of Vought International.

685
00:35:53,937 --> 00:35:56,773
Already, an intense international outcry

686
00:35:56,815 --> 00:35:58,525
has emerged, under...

687
00:35:58,566 --> 00:36:00,486
I can't believe I
actually have to say this,

688
00:36:00,487 --> 00:36:03,072
this day and age, but Nazis are bad.

689
00:36:03,113 --> 00:36:07,034
âª Nazi Stormfront, Hitler's star âª

690
00:36:07,076 --> 00:36:10,496
âª Run her over with a car. âª

691
00:36:10,538 --> 00:36:11,747
It's catchy.

692
00:36:15,167 --> 00:36:17,003
- You ready?
- Oui.

693
00:36:30,017 --> 00:36:34,146
But the question now is how can
we possibly let Vought release

694
00:36:34,188 --> 00:36:38,317
Compound V in light of this
unprecedented malfeasance?

695
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:40,239
- What's "malfeasance"?
- A Nazi in Seven Tower?

696
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,280
- Uh, it's a...
- Was she part of the attack...

697
00:36:42,321 --> 00:36:44,202
Never mind.

698
00:36:44,203 --> 00:36:45,742
Aah!

699
00:36:45,784 --> 00:36:47,578
- What's happening?
- Don't know.

700
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:49,371
Stay here.

701
00:36:53,792 --> 00:36:55,085
Now!

702
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,940
Ryan! Hey! Hey.

703
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:17,943
Hey. Hey. Bud. Hey.

704
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:20,237
- Mom? Mom...
- It's me.

705
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,822
- Come here.
- Mom, Mom. I'm so sorry.

706
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,490
I didn't mean anything I said.

707
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:24,950
I'm sorry. I didn't mean any of it.

708
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:27,119
It's okay.

709
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,955
- We got to go.
- I love you so much.

710
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:31,917
You're okay. We're gonna
go, okay? Come on.

711
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,376
Who's that?

712
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,047
That's my husband.

713
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,965
It's all right.

714
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,884
Come on.

715
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:41,928
I got you.

716
00:37:43,346 --> 00:37:45,765
Come on. To the car, this way.

717
00:38:04,368 --> 00:38:05,994
What the fuck?

718
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:08,515
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- What the hell

719
00:38:08,516 --> 00:38:10,165
are they doing back here?

720
00:38:10,207 --> 00:38:13,419
Butcher, this wasn't the plan.

721
00:38:13,461 --> 00:38:15,046
What's going on?

722
00:38:15,088 --> 00:38:16,422
What's wrong?

723
00:38:16,464 --> 00:38:18,841
Take my car, get them both to Mallory.

724
00:38:18,883 --> 00:38:20,259
Get them both safe.

725
00:38:20,261 --> 00:38:21,701
No, no. That's not part of the plan.

726
00:38:21,702 --> 00:38:22,971
The plan just changed.

727
00:38:23,012 --> 00:38:24,692
M.M., you're the only
one I trust with 'em.

728
00:38:24,722 --> 00:38:26,600
Hey. What's happening? No.

729
00:38:26,642 --> 00:38:29,561
M.M.'s gonna take you
to a woman with the CIA.

730
00:38:29,603 --> 00:38:31,397
What? No, you have to come with us.

731
00:38:31,438 --> 00:38:33,857
I cut a deal with Stan Edgar.

732
00:38:36,735 --> 00:38:38,779
What?

733
00:38:38,821 --> 00:38:41,324
I cut a deal that when I got
Ryan, that I would call Vought.

734
00:38:41,366 --> 00:38:43,159
They were gonna come and take him away,

735
00:38:43,201 --> 00:38:45,912
and that you'd never
fucking see him again.

736
00:38:46,955 --> 00:38:48,206
What?

737
00:38:49,457 --> 00:38:52,669
But fuck me, I-I couldn't do it.

738
00:38:58,884 --> 00:39:00,678
- Bedroom's clear.
- Kitchen's clear.

739
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,264
- All rooms secure.
- Mr. Butcher?

740
00:39:03,305 --> 00:39:05,266
You here?

741
00:39:16,111 --> 00:39:18,947
Did I hear you say "Butcher"?

742
00:39:20,032 --> 00:39:21,658
What's going on?

743
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,421
Do you have the boy?

744
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:41,555
Where's my son?

745
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:48,353
Where is my son?!

746
00:39:48,395 --> 00:39:51,816
I'm not... I'm not leaving here
without you. I don't care.

747
00:39:51,858 --> 00:39:53,943
I was gonna sell you out.

748
00:39:53,985 --> 00:39:55,612
I fucking well might do it again.

749
00:39:55,653 --> 00:39:57,947
You didn't, though. You
didn't and you won't.

750
00:39:57,989 --> 00:39:59,866
You can't have a cunt
like me around that kid.

751
00:39:59,908 --> 00:40:02,327
I don't want to pass my shit on to him.

752
00:40:02,368 --> 00:40:04,264
Don't say that. You
have to come with us.

753
00:40:04,265 --> 00:40:05,265
You raise him right.

754
00:40:05,266 --> 00:40:07,335
- You fucking raise him right.
- No. Don't say that.

755
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:08,898
And I'll make sure they never find you.

756
00:40:08,899 --> 00:40:10,419
Don't you say that! Stop it. Stop.

757
00:40:10,461 --> 00:40:13,214
- You have to come with us.
- Becca, we are out of time.

758
00:40:14,673 --> 00:40:15,841
Please.

759
00:40:15,883 --> 00:40:18,636
You got to let me do this.

760
00:40:18,677 --> 00:40:21,181
You got to let me do
this one fucking thing.

761
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,207
Becca!

762
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:36,511
There you are, you
slippery little bitch!

763
00:41:36,553 --> 00:41:39,681
I'm assuming it's you who sent
all those lies to the press.

764
00:41:39,723 --> 00:41:40,974
They're not lies.

765
00:41:41,016 --> 00:41:43,435
The pictures are clearly deepfakes,

766
00:41:43,476 --> 00:41:45,395
and you're a lying slut.

767
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,904
Okay.

768
00:41:52,945 --> 00:41:55,948
Come here.

769
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:58,534
People love what I have to say.

770
00:41:58,576 --> 00:42:00,620
They believe in it.

771
00:42:00,661 --> 00:42:04,791
They just don't like the
word "Nazi", that's all.

772
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:07,002
Are you all right?

773
00:42:07,044 --> 00:42:08,837
- You all right? Yeah?
- Ryan. Ryan, Ryan.

774
00:42:08,879 --> 00:42:12,507
- Ryan. Ryan!
- Ryan. Come here.

775
00:42:15,929 --> 00:42:17,305
Are you okay? Are you okay?

776
00:42:17,347 --> 00:42:19,307
Go. We'll hold her off.

777
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:20,850
You're okay.

778
00:42:24,812 --> 00:42:26,397
What about the truth?

779
00:42:26,439 --> 00:42:28,858
What truth?

780
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,195
What is the truth?

781
00:42:47,504 --> 00:42:49,464
And what are you laughing at?

782
00:42:56,596 --> 00:42:59,308
She says the truth is,

783
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:02,645
she's gonna stick her
boot up your Nazi kitty.

784
00:43:17,202 --> 00:43:18,912
Annie!

785
00:43:18,954 --> 00:43:20,580
Come on, the RPG!

786
00:43:20,622 --> 00:43:22,749
It's in the car! It's our only chance!

787
00:44:16,432 --> 00:44:19,602
Hey, Kraut.

788
00:44:38,538 --> 00:44:40,208
âª You've got them all by the balls âª

789
00:44:40,249 --> 00:44:41,376
âª Causin' waterfalls âª

790
00:44:41,417 --> 00:44:42,585
âª Stone walls, bar brawls âª

791
00:44:42,627 --> 00:44:44,921
âª Common stalls that cause 'em all âª

792
00:44:44,962 --> 00:44:47,090
âª To you they crawl, body sprawl âª

793
00:44:47,131 --> 00:44:50,009
âª Smokin' Pall Malls,
close call, stand tall âª

794
00:44:50,051 --> 00:44:51,594
âª Doll, you make them feel so small âª

795
00:44:51,636 --> 00:44:53,054
âª And they love it... âª

796
00:44:53,096 --> 00:44:55,140
Eat my shit, you Nazi bitch!

797
00:44:55,182 --> 00:44:57,017
Die, you bitch!

798
00:44:57,059 --> 00:44:58,644
Girls do get it done.

799
00:44:58,685 --> 00:45:00,396
Yeah!

800
00:45:02,022 --> 00:45:04,233
Bitch!

801
00:45:16,362 --> 00:45:17,622
Are you okay?

802
00:45:17,664 --> 00:45:18,723
Yeah.

803
00:45:49,906 --> 00:45:51,534
Come here, Ryan.

804
00:45:51,576 --> 00:45:53,411
Not on your life.

805
00:45:56,998 --> 00:45:59,917
You're not like her, Ryan.
You belong with us.

806
00:45:59,959 --> 00:46:01,919
Stay the fuck away from my son!

807
00:46:01,961 --> 00:46:03,212
We love you, Ryan.

808
00:46:09,136 --> 00:46:10,387
You fucking bitch.

809
00:46:12,598 --> 00:46:13,598
Stop! Stop it!

810
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,851
Stop, please. Stop it!

811
00:46:15,893 --> 00:46:17,644
Stop, you're hurting
her. Just let her...

812
00:46:17,686 --> 00:46:19,964
Stop it!

813
00:46:20,006 --> 00:46:21,078
Stop, you're hurting her.

814
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:22,650
Just let her go.

815
00:46:23,735 --> 00:46:26,029
Let her go!

816
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:29,073
- Stop!
- Look at me.

817
00:46:29,115 --> 00:46:30,875
I like to see the light go out.

818
00:46:30,876 --> 00:46:32,202
Stop!

819
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:24,091
I'm sorry.

820
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:25,676
I'm sorry, Mom.

821
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:32,267
No. No...

822
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,311
No. No, no, no.

823
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:37,897
Hold on.

824
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:39,899
I'm sorry.

825
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:42,986
Help us!

826
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:46,365
Somebody help us!

827
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:53,664
It's not his fault. It's not his fault.

828
00:47:53,706 --> 00:47:55,374
You make sure he knows that.

829
00:47:55,416 --> 00:47:57,835
He, uh...

830
00:47:57,876 --> 00:48:00,630
He's good. He's good.

831
00:48:03,049 --> 00:48:05,635
He's good.

832
00:48:07,804 --> 00:48:10,890
You promise me you'll keep him safe.

833
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:53,186
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

834
00:48:59,276 --> 00:49:01,987
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

835
00:49:02,029 --> 00:49:03,072
Mommy.

836
00:49:03,113 --> 00:49:04,865
Mom.

837
00:49:04,907 --> 00:49:07,117
Mom, please.

838
00:49:22,342 --> 00:49:23,968
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

839
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,341
Ryan?

840
00:50:02,385 --> 00:50:04,095
Did you do this?

841
00:50:05,138 --> 00:50:07,098
I didn't mean to.

842
00:50:10,811 --> 00:50:12,646
Let's go.

843
00:50:18,444 --> 00:50:20,779
Come here.

844
00:50:25,535 --> 00:50:26,745
Come.

845
00:50:29,706 --> 00:50:33,293
Ryan... Ryan.

846
00:50:33,334 --> 00:50:35,336
Come here.

847
00:50:44,847 --> 00:50:46,056
No.

848
00:51:00,614 --> 00:51:02,616
He's mine.

849
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:08,456
What, are you gonna blow yourself up...

850
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:11,709
to save the little shit who
fucking murdered your wife?

851
00:51:16,631 --> 00:51:18,466
I promised.

852
00:51:20,218 --> 00:51:22,638
- Have it your way.
- Stop.

853
00:51:26,058 --> 00:51:29,895
What are you doing here?

854
00:51:32,648 --> 00:51:34,858
You're gonna let them go.

855
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:38,696
And if I don't?

856
00:51:40,949 --> 00:51:42,989
- Please!
- Don't die with them.

857
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:46,079
Let them go.

858
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,915
- Maeve!
- You're gonna stop hunting Starlight,

859
00:51:48,957 --> 00:51:51,794
you're gonna leave me and Elena alone...

860
00:51:51,836 --> 00:51:53,212
Take my daughter!

861
00:51:53,254 --> 00:51:55,005
...or I release this.

862
00:51:56,632 --> 00:51:58,634
If you do that...

863
00:52:00,845 --> 00:52:03,264
...I'll destroy everything

864
00:52:03,305 --> 00:52:05,475
- and everyone.
- Great.

865
00:52:05,517 --> 00:52:07,644
As long as everyone sees

866
00:52:07,686 --> 00:52:10,313
what a fucking monster you are.

867
00:52:11,982 --> 00:52:13,525
As long as no one

868
00:52:13,567 --> 00:52:16,027
ever loves you again.

869
00:52:22,952 --> 00:52:26,080
Homelander! Homelander!

870
00:52:26,122 --> 00:52:27,498
Homelander!

871
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:30,710
Homelander! Homelander...

872
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:13,714
We believe that Stormfront

873
00:53:13,756 --> 00:53:17,427
was the sole perpetrator of
the attack on Washington.

874
00:53:17,469 --> 00:53:20,847
In the light of Stormfront's atrocities,

875
00:53:20,889 --> 00:53:25,560
the release of Compound V has
been placed on indefinite hold.

876
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:28,021
Homelander?

877
00:53:28,063 --> 00:53:30,023
Mr. Edgar, we have a follow-up question.

878
00:53:34,737 --> 00:53:37,531
Thanks to the heroism of
Queen Maeve and Starlight,

879
00:53:37,573 --> 00:53:39,909
Stormfront has been neutralized,

880
00:53:39,951 --> 00:53:43,329
and is being held in an
undisclosed location.

881
00:53:43,371 --> 00:53:46,917
I would personally like
to apologize to Starlight,

882
00:53:46,959 --> 00:53:50,837
who was wrongfully accused
of sabotage and conspiracy.

883
00:53:50,879 --> 00:53:53,048
Welcome back to the team.

884
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:56,635
And I know that you and
Maeve are two of the best,

885
00:53:56,677 --> 00:54:00,013
most loyal friends
that I could ever have.

886
00:54:00,055 --> 00:54:02,850
We are your heroes.

887
00:54:02,892 --> 00:54:05,687
We are here to serve and protect you.

888
00:54:05,728 --> 00:54:09,440
Stormfront's violation of
that special relationship,

889
00:54:09,482 --> 00:54:13,319
of that trust, is unacceptable

890
00:54:13,361 --> 00:54:15,906
and she will be punished.

891
00:54:15,948 --> 00:54:18,325
Justice will be served.

892
00:54:28,377 --> 00:54:31,715
Justice will be served.
She will be punished.

893
00:54:31,756 --> 00:54:35,969
As the leader of the Seven,
I give you my word,

894
00:54:36,011 --> 00:54:38,596
no one will ever...

895
00:54:40,473 --> 00:54:42,892
Gentlemen, thank you for coming.

896
00:54:42,934 --> 00:54:45,354
Always happy to see you, sir.

897
00:54:45,396 --> 00:54:46,564
I'm afraid we had

898
00:54:46,605 --> 00:54:49,233
an incident at the Archives.

899
00:54:49,275 --> 00:54:52,445
Someone broke in and
stole PDR on Stormfront.

900
00:54:52,486 --> 00:54:55,156
Hmm. PDR?

901
00:54:55,197 --> 00:54:56,365
Private data reserve.

902
00:54:56,407 --> 00:54:59,995
No one saw the thief come or go.

903
00:55:00,037 --> 00:55:03,415
Isn't that right, A-Train?

904
00:55:05,459 --> 00:55:07,002
That was you? Dude.

905
00:55:07,044 --> 00:55:09,129
I didn't know, sir. Fuck him.

906
00:55:09,171 --> 00:55:11,131
- I would never go behind your back.
- Please,

907
00:55:11,173 --> 00:55:14,552
- just let me explain.
- I think it showed initiative.

908
00:55:14,594 --> 00:55:17,388
Stormfront's been critical of
the Church for a long time,

909
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:20,767
and Vought needs to take a
firm anti-Nazi stance right now.

910
00:55:20,808 --> 00:55:22,393
Wait.

911
00:55:22,435 --> 00:55:25,396
- D-Does that mean...
- I just spoke to Stan Edgar.

912
00:55:25,438 --> 00:55:26,899
You're back in.

913
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:28,901
- Fuck yeah!
- What? Yeah!

914
00:55:28,942 --> 00:55:30,944
Yeah! A-Train is back, baby!

915
00:55:30,986 --> 00:55:32,696
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

916
00:55:32,738 --> 00:55:34,490
- All right!
- Whew!

917
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:37,159
- Finally!
- Yeah.

918
00:55:37,201 --> 00:55:40,412
I'm back too, right?
Right? I'm anti-Nazi.

919
00:55:40,454 --> 00:55:44,250
I'm sorry, Deep, but
they only had one slot.

920
00:55:44,292 --> 00:55:46,920
One hero is redemption, two is weakness.

921
00:55:46,961 --> 00:55:48,338
So they took him?

922
00:55:48,379 --> 00:55:50,340
Fuck yes, they did!

923
00:55:50,381 --> 00:55:53,176
Well, shit! Peace out, bitch!

924
00:55:53,218 --> 00:55:54,844
Ha ha!

925
00:55:56,889 --> 00:55:59,100
You have to be patient, Deep.

926
00:55:59,141 --> 00:56:01,602
We'll get you into a few more
courses, up to Level Seven.

927
00:56:01,644 --> 00:56:03,724
No, I don't want to pay for
any more fucking courses!

928
00:56:03,725 --> 00:56:04,730
Deep, please calm down.

929
00:56:04,772 --> 00:56:06,482
I signed over my bank account to you.

930
00:56:06,524 --> 00:56:09,026
I filled out all those fucking
children's workbooks!

931
00:56:09,068 --> 00:56:12,280
I married some weirdo who
gives terrible blowjobs!

932
00:56:12,322 --> 00:56:15,659
I-I did everything you asked,
and when I found out that

933
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,953
we're all just fucking space
spores, I didn't laugh.

934
00:56:17,994 --> 00:56:19,871
I did everything you asked.

935
00:56:19,913 --> 00:56:21,915
Because you said you'd
get me back in the Seven.

936
00:56:21,957 --> 00:56:24,334
- You fucking promised.
- I'm sorry, Deep,

937
00:56:24,377 --> 00:56:26,796
but you are acting
like a toxic personality.

938
00:56:26,838 --> 00:56:28,464
I think you should leave.

939
00:56:34,595 --> 00:56:35,805
Fuck Fresca.

940
00:56:43,272 --> 00:56:45,232
Look at you.

941
00:56:45,274 --> 00:56:48,026
I know. I know...

942
00:56:48,068 --> 00:56:51,947
But if Billy Butcher
can do the right thing,

943
00:56:51,989 --> 00:56:56,661
then there's got to be
some kind of higher power.

944
00:56:58,705 --> 00:57:00,540
You know?

945
00:57:00,582 --> 00:57:04,294
Are you sure it's safe for you
to go back into the Tower?

946
00:57:04,335 --> 00:57:06,296
No.

947
00:57:06,337 --> 00:57:09,383
No, I'm not. But...

948
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:12,136
If you jump ship and you
let the assholes steer,

949
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:16,140
then you're part of the problem.

950
00:57:17,933 --> 00:57:19,727
- And...
- Hmm.

951
00:57:19,768 --> 00:57:23,523
...someone taught me something
about hanging in there.

952
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:39,457
I've been thinking about that lately...

953
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:42,001
the hanging in there.

954
00:57:42,043 --> 00:57:45,421
And I think maybe I am too clingy.

955
00:57:45,463 --> 00:57:47,506
- No, you're not.
- Sticking with people

956
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:50,384
just because I'm
terrified of losing them?

957
00:57:50,426 --> 00:57:51,803
I-I...

958
00:57:51,845 --> 00:57:55,265
I can't do that anymore.

959
00:57:56,516 --> 00:57:59,228
I think it's time I go off,

960
00:57:59,269 --> 00:58:01,480
stand on my own two feet for once.

961
00:58:05,318 --> 00:58:08,112
Right. Um...

962
00:58:11,616 --> 00:58:14,869
Yeah, no worries. We'll, um...

963
00:58:16,871 --> 00:58:18,706
We'll just be friends, then.

964
00:58:18,748 --> 00:58:20,334
Oh... oh, God, no. No, no, no.

965
00:58:20,376 --> 00:58:22,496
I'm still gonna cling onto
you, I'm not fucking crazy.

966
00:58:44,025 --> 00:58:47,153
So, if you weren't talking about me,

967
00:58:47,195 --> 00:58:48,823
who were you talking about?

968
00:58:54,745 --> 00:58:56,455
I'm scared.

969
00:59:12,848 --> 00:59:15,100
This here...

970
00:59:15,142 --> 00:59:17,270
belonged to your mum.

971
00:59:17,312 --> 00:59:20,148
This is St. Christopher.

972
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:23,359
She gave it to me a long time ago,

973
00:59:23,401 --> 00:59:26,404
and told me...

974
00:59:26,446 --> 00:59:27,989
it would keep me safe.

975
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:30,450
And it has.

976
00:59:31,952 --> 00:59:33,829
Mostly.

977
00:59:41,962 --> 00:59:45,549
Now your mum...

978
00:59:45,591 --> 00:59:47,302
is gonna help keep you safe.

979
00:59:55,602 --> 00:59:57,187
Come on.

980
01:00:04,737 --> 01:00:06,614
Now...

981
01:00:06,655 --> 01:00:08,991
remember what I told you.

982
01:00:10,034 --> 01:00:11,327
Don't be a cunt.

983
01:00:30,098 --> 01:00:32,600
William, I'm so sorry.

984
01:00:35,228 --> 01:00:37,188
Vought's gonna want him back.

985
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:39,399
Let me handle Vought.

986
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,318
You think he'll turn into his father?

987
01:00:47,199 --> 01:00:49,952
Becca didn't think so.

988
01:00:50,994 --> 01:00:53,872
I pray she's right.

989
01:00:53,914 --> 01:00:56,834
All the charges against you and
the Boys have been dropped.

990
01:00:56,875 --> 01:00:58,586
Even for the crimes you did commit.

991
01:00:58,628 --> 01:01:00,338
You're a free man.

992
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:04,259
And the White House is opening
an Office of Supe Affairs.

993
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:06,803
Victoria Neuman is the new czar.

994
01:01:06,845 --> 01:01:09,556
She's sneaking me some
off-the-books funding

995
01:01:09,597 --> 01:01:11,933
for a team that can
keep tabs on the Supes.

996
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:15,229
If you're interested.

997
01:01:34,749 --> 01:01:38,753
âª I may not always love you âª

998
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:43,676
âª But long as there
are stars above you âª

999
01:01:43,718 --> 01:01:47,263
âª You never need to doubt it âª

1000
01:01:47,305 --> 01:01:51,684
âª I'll make you so sure about it âª

1001
01:01:51,726 --> 01:01:56,231
âª God only knows what
I'd be without you âª

1002
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:04,031
âª If you should ever leave me âª

1003
01:02:04,072 --> 01:02:06,007
âª Well, life would still go on âª

1004
01:02:06,008 --> 01:02:08,035
- âª Believe me âª
- Where to?

1005
01:02:08,076 --> 01:02:12,123
- âª The world could show nothing to me âª
- Dancing.

1006
01:02:12,165 --> 01:02:16,419
âª So what good would living do me? âª

1007
01:02:16,461 --> 01:02:21,424
âª God only knows what
I'd be without you âª

1008
01:02:24,678 --> 01:02:28,849
âª God only knows what
I'd be without you âª

1009
01:02:28,891 --> 01:02:31,936
âª God only knows what
I'd be without you... âª

1010
01:02:31,977 --> 01:02:36,190
I can do whatever I want.

1011
01:02:38,192 --> 01:02:40,654
I can do whatever...

1012
01:02:40,695 --> 01:02:44,032
I want.

1013
01:02:46,117 --> 01:02:48,286
I can do...

1014
01:02:48,328 --> 01:02:50,205
whatever I want.

1015
01:02:50,247 --> 01:02:52,332
âª What I'd be without you... âª

1016
01:02:52,374 --> 01:02:56,045
I can do whatever the fuck I want!

1017
01:02:56,087 --> 01:03:00,091
I can do whatever the fuck I...

1018
01:03:00,132 --> 01:03:02,134
want!

1019
01:03:02,176 --> 01:03:05,179
Congratulations on the
appointment, Congresswoman.

1020
01:03:05,221 --> 01:03:08,016
It's about time we had
an Office of Supe Affairs.

1021
01:03:08,058 --> 01:03:10,298
Well, I know it was your intel
that took Stormfront down.

1022
01:03:10,299 --> 01:03:11,478
So, thank you.

1023
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,647
Yeah, and that's just the start.

1024
01:03:13,689 --> 01:03:17,442
We have enough dirt
to ruin a dozen Supes.

1025
01:03:17,484 --> 01:03:19,987
Be a death blow for Stan Edgar.

1026
01:03:20,028 --> 01:03:21,738
That is, of course,

1027
01:03:21,781 --> 01:03:23,700
if you're open to, uh, expediting

1028
01:03:23,741 --> 01:03:26,286
the Church's tax-exempt status.

1029
01:03:26,327 --> 01:03:28,746
Small price to pay.

1030
01:03:28,788 --> 01:03:30,707
Call my office, set up a meeting?

1031
01:03:30,748 --> 01:03:33,293
You are one of the good ones, Vic.

1032
01:03:33,334 --> 01:03:36,422
- See you soon.
- See you.

1033
01:04:17,423 --> 01:04:18,633
Hi.

1034
01:04:21,261 --> 01:04:23,472
- Here's the research you asked for.
- Thank you.

1035
01:04:23,513 --> 01:04:25,682
- And your 2:00 is waiting.
- Thank you.

1036
01:04:27,768 --> 01:04:28,977
Hugh Campbell.

1037
01:04:31,021 --> 01:04:34,275
I don't know how to repay
you for what you did.

1038
01:04:34,317 --> 01:04:36,903
- You know, I can think of a way.
- Oh?

1039
01:04:36,944 --> 01:04:40,740
You can... give me a job.

1040
01:04:41,783 --> 01:04:43,076
You serious?

1041
01:04:43,117 --> 01:04:45,328
Uh, what about your team?

1042
01:04:45,370 --> 01:04:48,248
Don't get me wrong, I-I-I still
want to fight Vought, I just...

1043
01:04:48,290 --> 01:04:50,793
I want to do it the right way.

1044
01:04:50,834 --> 01:04:52,544
Not covered in quite as many guts.

1045
01:04:52,586 --> 01:04:55,506
Look, the truth is,

1046
01:04:55,547 --> 01:04:58,133
I never totally fit in with the guys.

1047
01:04:58,175 --> 01:05:03,139
And... I think it's time I
stand on my own two feet.

1048
01:05:05,183 --> 01:05:08,228
- They know you're here?
- I haven't told them yet.

1049
01:05:09,688 --> 01:05:12,190
When can you start?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
