2
00:00:15,034 --> 00:00:17,394
Freedom...

3
00:00:17,395 --> 00:00:19,145
...comes at a price.

4
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,188
- So, I'm down a point?
- Nine and a half.

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,231
Bad day?

6
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:24,483
- Goddamn it.
- Hey, I'm with you.

7
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,277
But you know, there's
a way to handle it.

8
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:27,319
I owe you.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,240
Thanks to the Church of the Collective,

10
00:00:31,282 --> 00:00:33,033
I now know the kind of man I want to be.

11
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:35,578
- #BraveMaeve.
- This is Homelander.

12
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,413
He's fucking with me.
I can't protect you

13
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:38,622
if you leave.

14
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:39,832
What are we gonna do?

15
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,751
You think, by saving Kimiko,

16
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,002
you can make amends

17
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,420
for those children

18
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:46,342
- that Lamplighter burned.
- Fuck you.

19
00:00:46,343 --> 00:00:47,663
You can't go through this

20
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,633
- on your own.
- We're all alone.

21
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:59,226
How do you think the world
will feel when I tell them that

22
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:00,811
you used to be Liberty?

23
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:02,354
Wow.

24
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:19,914
Why are you laughing?

25
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:21,540
- You're ridiculous.
- Oh, no.

26
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,417
I am not, uh, ridiculous.

27
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:24,794
Okay.

28
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:26,962
- Then you are high.
- Well, beside the point.

29
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:29,715
- Mm-hmm.
- Point is

30
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:32,051
I learned everything I
know from those girls.

31
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,412
"The Golden Girls"?

32
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:37,431
I was alone in New York, you know?

33
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:39,433
Turning tricks.

34
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:42,436
Begging for the scraps.

35
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,856
Who do you think kept me company?

36
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:47,233
"The Golden Girls".

37
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,026
3:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m.,

38
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:51,979
they lit up the shelter's shitty TV.

39
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:53,638
And you're not talking about porn?

40
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:55,156
"The Golden Shower Girls"?

41
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:56,597
- That's disrespectful.
- Aw.

42
00:01:56,598 --> 00:01:58,118
He's so sensitive.

43
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,538
No. Those saucy ladies,

44
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,540
they made their own family.

45
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,501
So I did what they did.

46
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:08,587
You are my Blanche.

47
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,089
- Blanche?
- And Jay?

48
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:13,676
You are...

49
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,636
- my Dorothy.
- Mm-hmm.

50
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:17,096
'Cause you're a little gay.

51
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,098
Yeah.

52
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,225
- So, you're Betty White?
- Oh,

53
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:22,726
what a fucking question.

54
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,728
Of course I'm Betty White.

55
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:29,275
Now...

56
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,321
Who wants to rob a bank?

57
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:35,739
Fuck, yeah.

58
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:43,998
Will it get through my skin?

59
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,958
If it can't, nothing can.

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,293
Okay, I-I just feel like I
need to say something.

61
00:02:48,294 --> 00:02:49,712
I don't think this is a good idea.

62
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,589
Stormfront knows I leaked the V.

63
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,799
Yeah, but she hasn't come after you.

64
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,467
Ye... But that makes it so much worse.

65
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,137
That means that she has
some fucked-up plan for me.

66
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,930
I need this chip out now.

67
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:01,807
I understand, Petit Hughie.

68
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,685
And though you've been covered
with entrails of many a person,

69
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:06,270
even a sea mammal...

70
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:08,981
it's always harder when
it's someone you love.

71
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:10,482
- What?
- L'amour.

72
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:13,402
No, no. No, I don't.

73
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:14,862
I mean, I-I do, of course.

74
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:16,530
It's just, it's a platon...

75
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:17,932
- We're-we're just friends.
- Okay,

76
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:19,973
can we just do this already
before I change my mind?

77
00:03:19,974 --> 00:03:20,974
Please?

78
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,717
Okay, this is happening.

79
00:03:23,718 --> 00:03:25,581
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

80
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:28,417
- This might sting a little.
- Okay.

81
00:03:38,095 --> 00:03:40,695
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

82
00:03:40,696 --> 00:03:42,473
Okay.

83
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:43,766
Okay.

84
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,863
Bonjour, my little spy.

85
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,842
Howdy ho, buckaroo.

86
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:24,598
Shit!

87
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,016
I think you broke my hand.

88
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:32,898
What do you want to do with him?

89
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,650
Well, hand him over to the police,

90
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:37,069
- of course.
- Well, of course. We are heroes.

91
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:39,113
That's what heroes do.

92
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:42,074
- Absolutely.
- But...

93
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:44,149
he'll probably just
be released tomorrow.

94
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,537
- Please, just take me to the hospital.
- Yeah.

95
00:04:46,558 --> 00:04:47,558
Please.

96
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,957
That's a really good point.

97
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:51,834
You know,

98
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,836
sometimes it feels like...
like the justice system

99
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,797
just doesn't work anymore.

100
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:00,426
Everyone always recording
on their phone all the time.

101
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,261
- Mm-hmm.
- It's like you can't even

102
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,062
- do your job anymore.
- Do your job anymore.

103
00:05:04,063 --> 00:05:05,761
Mm-hmm.

104
00:05:05,803 --> 00:05:08,308
Please, just take me in.
Just take me in, please.

Well, you're welcome.

124
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:01,295
Let's be honest for a moment here.

125
00:06:01,296 --> 00:06:03,781
Who is the biggest prankster on set?

126
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:07,034
Ooh, I-I just... I don't think

127
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:09,286
we should get into that. I
don't know, I... No comment.

128
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:12,915
I mean, he is right.

129
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,918
But, uh, you know, Black
Noir has definitely got

130
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,253
- just the biggest ego.
- Such a diva.

131
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,588
They're fucking.

132
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,007
...under that helmet.

133
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,684
Did you get her chip out?

134
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,103
This is where you're living?

135
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,396
Yeah. You know, it has its charms.

136
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:39,483
The rats are, like, uh, Pokémon.

137
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:41,693
- With hep C.
- Oh, God.

138
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,612
Oh, so you're back?

139
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,407
Tired of killing people for money?

140
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:55,457
Uh, hi.

141
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,046
Remember me?

142
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,019
Well, well, well.

143
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,021
What have we here?

144
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,151
I know what you're gonna say,

145
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,153
but we just took out her
chip. Everything's fine.

146
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:27,489
Starlight, don't you just
light up a room, eh?

147
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:30,576
- You're looking well.
- Yeah, no thanks

148
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,036
to the .50-caliber round that
you pumped into my chest.

149
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:37,040
Well, what don't kill
you makes you stronger.

150
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,126
Hmm.

151
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:42,004
What's she doing here?

152
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:45,424
Uh, she has a lead on Stormfront.

153
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,865
I broke into her laptop,

154
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:48,118
and I got a look at the inbox.

155
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,345
Dozens of e-mails from Stan Edgar.

156
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:53,140
Stan Edgar?

157
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:56,268
And what does Vought's
big slapper have to say?

158
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,895
How they're close to a breakthrough

159
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,897
at the Sage Grove Center.

160
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,482
It's a psychiatric
hospital in Pennsylvania.

161
00:08:02,484 --> 00:08:04,164
Wait, wh-what kind of breakthrough?

162
00:08:04,165 --> 00:08:06,403
She came in before I could see any more.

163
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:09,198
Well, we better have us

164
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,617
a little dekko at this
loony bin, eh, lads?

165
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:13,952
Starlight,

166
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,163
would you be amenable to joining us

167
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:18,165
on this little caper?

168
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:19,917
You want her to come?

169
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,752
Oh, most definitely.

170
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,003
If shit goes sideways,

171
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,963
who do you think
Vought's gonna go after?

172
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:29,343
Us or their billion-dollar
baby turned traitor

173
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,929
who just ripped out
her own fucking chip?

174
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:36,058
Never go into shark-infested waters

175
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,643
without chum.

176
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:47,319
♪ Give a little bit of love... ♪

177
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:48,946
This is who I am.

178
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,781
Who are you?

179
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,116
Brave Maeve Pride Bars.

180
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:56,119
Because you can't be proud
on an empty stomach.

181
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,165
Come in.

182
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,503
You fucking idiot.

183
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,673
You were supposed to call
first. Did anyone see you?

184
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,633
I'm allowed to visit my friends.

185
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:11,343
Did you find it?

186
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:13,971
No, sorry. No black box.

187
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:16,932
But I told a couple of my contacts

188
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:18,934
to keep an eye on the
North Atlantic Current.

189
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,602
So, this school of halibut... I mean,

these guys are, like, rowdy
motherfuckers, right? They...

00:09:22,885 --> 00:09:24,231
Deep.

192
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:27,484
Anyway, they found some of the wreckage

193
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:29,194
that drifted up near Iceland.

194
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,280
And they found this.

195
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:37,160
I mean, I'm not sure it
still even works, but...

196
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:43,166
You want back in the Seven?

197
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,378
Not a fucking word of this to anyone.

Yeah, it's dope.

208
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:12,821
Well, this is just the demo, of course.

209
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,699
We're going out to Lil Nas
X for the official version.

210
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:18,201
Maybe you could bust out
Prince's guitar for the video.

211
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,203
I had to sell Prince's guitar.

212
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,580
I'm going 10-1.

213
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,081
Okay.

214
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,333
Ashley.

215
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,876
- What?
- I can't find her.

216
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:28,170
Where the fuck is Starlight?

217
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,764
Yo! Here comes the A-Train.

218
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,432
What, what?

219
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,434
I'm right here, buddy. Over here.

220
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,436
- Yeah.
- What's up, buddy?

221
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,772
- Good to see you.
- What you doing here, man?

222
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,816
Oh, not much. Just
here to see, uh, uh...

223
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,860
No reason, really.

224
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:54,654
But, hey, bro, I've been
thinking about you lately.

225
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,281
Yeah, I'm sorry.

226
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:59,159
I see what they're trying
to do to you. Yeah.

227
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:01,411
Talk about getting
ass-fucked with a soup can.

228
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:02,621
Am I right?

229
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,914
What do you mean?

230
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,540
I mean, come on.

231
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,126
If anyone knows what it's
like to get bounced, it's me.

232
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,462
Yeah. Did some shit
I'm not too proud of.

233
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,798
Some weird shit.

234
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,133
I'm good, man.

235
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,511
Nike and Under Armour are
already talking to my people,

236
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,312
so, you know, this is
actually gonna work out

237
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:21,390
to be really fantastic for me.

238
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,475
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

239
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:26,895
Yeah. Well, then, uh, I guess
you don't need his help.

240
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:28,772
Or, uh... No, never mind.

241
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:30,190
Forget I even said anything.

242
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:33,193
But hey, it's great to
see you, man. Always.

243
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:34,778
All right.

244
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,072
Whose?

245
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:40,117
Whose help?

246
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,204
Would you like a Fresca?

248

00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:02,889
a subsidiary of...

250
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,599
I can guess.

251
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:06,893
Thanks.

252
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,896
Here.

253
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,609
This is what you bought

254
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,987
with your blood money?

255
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:20,490
No one will believe you're an
orderly with that, you know.

256
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:29,916
I should go in with them.

257
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,127
They can manage without
one bony, blonde Supe.

258
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:33,587
You just get them in

259
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:34,880
and get the fuck back, yeah?

260
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,882
Okay, just...

261
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:42,345
If anybody recognizes your
face in there, I mean...

262
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,354
Oi, Frenchie.

263
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:54,232
Don't get caught.

264
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,860
I never do.

265
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:08,914
Weaponized Xanax.

266
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,626
The grenades you used on Behemoth

267
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,085
during the bank heist.

268
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,464
You got a Supe activated by rage,

269
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:18,840
so you simply take away his rage,

270
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:20,258
turn him into a cupcake.

271
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,260
Clever.

272
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:26,264
I don't know what you are talking about.

273
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,475
And Cold Snap two months ago?

274
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:30,101
Malchemical a month before that?

275
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,543
You don't know about those, either?

276
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,981
What is this about?

277
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,317
Armed robbery,

278
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:38,485
breaking and entering,

279
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:39,861
aggravated assault on a Supe.

280
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:42,864
You're looking at 20 to 25, minimum.

281
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:45,075
Or you can come work for me.

282
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,827
I could use someone
with your imagination.

283
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,664
Madame...

284
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,582
fuck you.

285
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:55,210
That's a pity,

286
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:57,629
for you...

287
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:01,049
...but even more so for Cherie and Jay,

288
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,093
I believe?

289
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,265
ADX Florence

290
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,475
is a supermax in Colorado.

291
00:14:10,478 --> 00:14:12,798
They've got the Unabomber,
head of the Aryan Brotherhood...

292
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:13,887
all the greats.

293
00:14:13,928 --> 00:14:15,897
And your friends, too. Maybe.

294
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:19,317
Or... they go free.

295
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,403
But that depends on you.

296
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,029
Right now.

297
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,031
You can't do that.

298
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,834
Wait.

299
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:43,300
What kind of work do you do?

300
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,181
Hey.

301
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,101
Um...

302
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:55,312
Come into my trailer for a second.

303
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,689
I have a surprise for you.

304
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,608
I have to stop by Vought Tower,

305
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,359
see my social guys.

306
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,402
No.

307
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,403
Come on. Blow them off.

308
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,447
Come.

309
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,866
I will be back in 20 minutes.

310
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,493
And then...

311
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:13,913
I'll let you surprise me
wherever you want.

312
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,957
Ooh.

313
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,757
Yeah, okay.

314
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:57,749
Hmm.

315
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,767
You see 'em?

316
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:16,935
Yeah.

317
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,687
I see 'em.

318
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:01,396
Get in.

319
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:28,798
Here.

320
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:34,304
Seriously?

321
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,890
What is your problem with me?

322
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,725
I ain't got no problem with you, love.

323
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,647
Really? That's why you
won't even touch my hand?

324
00:17:40,688 --> 00:17:42,048
Okay, guys, come on. Not the time.

325
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:43,104
You know what? No.

326
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:44,773
I think it's exactly the right time.

327
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,025
I think the time is long overdue.

328
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,694
You know that I hate
Vought as much as you do.

329
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,905
You know that. But it
doesn't even matter to you

330
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:55,742
because what you can't
stand is in my blood.

331
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:57,494
I'm subhuman to you.

332
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,954
Only good Supe is a dead Supe, right?

333
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,706
Your words, not mine.

334
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:02,791
That's enough.

335
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,042
You know what?

336
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,044
Underneath all that swagger,

337
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,464
you're just a bigot and a bully.

338
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:11,216
I know another guy just like that.

339
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,717
He's got a flag for a cape.

340
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,428
Annie, stop.

341
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,783
Oh, fuck me.

342
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:38,493
Hughie, call them. Now.

343
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,249
Open the door. We need help.

344
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,959
I have a patient that needs help.

345
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Hurry up! Please!

346
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,001
What's wrong with him?

347
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,082
Just open the goddamn door!

348
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,922
He's swallowing his fucking tongue!

349
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,302
- What's wrong with him?
- Easy.

350
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,947
Holy fuck.

351
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:33,172
What the fuck is all of this?

352
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:36,092
Vought is making more Supe terrorists?

353
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:38,219
Who the fuck knows?

354
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:42,599
Goddamn.

355
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,642
Brother's got a love sausage.

356
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:12,879
Stormfront is here?

357
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:16,132
How you doing today?

358
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:21,220
Do you want to show us a little
of what you've been working on?

359
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:24,057
Hey. Hey.

360
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,100
You're okay.

361
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,270
You're all right.

362
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:31,314
It's okay.

363
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:36,653
That is very impressive, Tim.

364
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:39,072
That orderly Stormfront's with...

365
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,741
he look familiar to you?

366
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,326
Je ne sais pas.

367
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:44,494
What about headaches?

368
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,245
Nausea?

369
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:47,914
No.

370
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:51,084
Well, that's promising.

371
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,253
I think we are getting close.

372
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:56,631
Ma'am,

373
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:59,258
can I go home now?

374
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,219
I want to see my family.

375
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,429
Tim, you were admitted to Sage Grove

376
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,807
because you're suicidal.

377
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,850
You could be a danger to yourself.

378
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:10,052
Well, I'm not doing any more
of these stupid pet tricks

379
00:21:10,053 --> 00:21:11,638
until I talk to my sister.

380
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:15,858
Okay. Okay.

381
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,152
We'll work something out.

382
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,221
Lamplighter.

383
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:48,124
- That's fucking Lamplighter.
- Shh...

384
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:50,646
I didn't recognize him without
the mask and the hood.

385
00:21:50,688 --> 00:21:52,804
Fucking Lamplighter. We
have to kill him, of course.

386
00:21:52,805 --> 00:21:54,048
No, no, no, no. No, we can't.

387
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:55,698
For Madame Mallory.
For her grandchildren.

388
00:21:55,699 --> 00:21:56,862
Not right now.

389
00:21:56,904 --> 00:22:00,278
First, we got to find out
what the fuck all this shit is.

390
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,947
- Come on.
- Listen, listen.

391
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,241
Stick to the plan, Frenchie.

392
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:17,295
- Hughie.
- There you are.

393
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,838
You guys okay? Stormfront's in there.

394
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,423
That ain't all who's here.

395
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,763
Okay, okay. She just left.
Get the hell out. Now.

396
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:29,098
All right, let's get
the fuck out of here.

397
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,937
Hey. Cindy.

398
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,191
Let's be cool.

399
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:21,526
Okay?

400
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,320
You remember that extra helping

401
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:27,448
of Kraft Shells & Cheese
that I snuck you?

402
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:31,911
I like you.

403
00:23:31,953 --> 00:23:33,287
You know that, right?

404
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:37,041
Who are your friends?

405
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,043
We ain't his friends.

406
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:41,045
Go ahead. Fuck his ass up.

407
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:43,548
You're dressed like his friends.

408
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,424
I don't like liars.

409
00:23:56,686 --> 00:23:58,688
Oh, shit...

410
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,358
Let's get out of here!

411
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,503
Hey. Let go!

412
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:27,592
Stay the fuck back or I will
burn your skin off, asshole!

413
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:28,793
Oh, you won't get the chance!

414
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:31,095
Someone help me!

415
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:48,237
All right, listen up, man.

416
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:50,406
You can burn us,

417
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:52,033
but she's a Supe.

418
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,368
All you're gonna do is piss her off.

419
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,370
So why don't we all just calm down

420
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,372
and live through this motherfucker?

421
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:06,356
- What's going on here?
- It's a lockdown.

422
00:25:06,368 --> 00:25:08,048
No one's getting out
of here, not even her.

423
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:09,424
There's got to be an access code.

424
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:10,884
There is, genius, at the front door.

425
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:12,136
And there is no fucking way

426
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:14,347
I am telling you or taking you with me.

427
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:16,828
You do realize there's a whole
army of Supes on the other side

428
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:19,040
of that door that want
to tear you apart, right?

429
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:22,063
She... can help.

430
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,153
I'm gonna take my chances.

431
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:59,058
Okay, you guys can come.

432
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:06,357
What the fuck?

433
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:13,614
Come on, M.M.

434
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:15,449
Pick up, damn you.

435
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,451
Your call has been forwarded

436
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:19,245
to an automated voice messaging system.

437
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:20,663
Marvin.

438
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:22,265
- Is not available.
- Oh, hello.

439
00:26:22,267 --> 00:26:23,867
At the tone, please record your message.

440
00:26:23,868 --> 00:26:25,584
Easy does it, lad.

441
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,003
No trouble from us.

442
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:29,338
You just stroll on by, yeah?

443
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:33,634
I don't want them to hurt me again.

444
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:41,600
Oh, nah. N-No one's gonna hurt you, son.

445
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:45,479
Uh... we're all friends here, aren't we?

446
00:27:15,123 --> 00:27:16,723
Hughie.

447
00:27:21,749 --> 00:27:23,284
Hughie.

448
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,982
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

449
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:33,235
Fine. Uh...

450
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,821
- Hughie? Hughie?
- Oh, shit.

451
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:38,866
Hughie! No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No.

452
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:40,576
Can you cauterize it?

453
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:42,787
Uh...

454
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:43,949
Oh, fuck.

455
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,388
The kid must have fried everything.

456
00:27:45,389 --> 00:27:46,665
- I need power.
- Well, you got

457
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:48,347
a pretty shite superpower
then, don't you?

458
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:50,002
We got to get him to a doctor.

459
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:52,213
- C... Where, how?
- I don't know, but not gonna

460
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,254
just sit here and watch
him fucking well bleed out!

461
00:27:54,296 --> 00:27:55,816
- All right?!
- Okay! Okay, okay, okay.

462
00:27:55,817 --> 00:27:56,863
- Come on.
- Come on.

463
00:27:57,935 --> 00:27:59,428
What about the others?

464
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,888
They're on their own.

465
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,675
Ashley? Oh, my God. Are you okay?

466
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,177
Don't you dare tell me you
haven't found Starlight yet.

467
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:44,014
Here.

468
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:57,736
I've been searching everywhere for you.

469
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,697
What happened to your trailer?

470
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,824
Electrical fire.

471
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:03,868
How was your meeting?

472
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,829
Sorry. It ran long.

473
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:09,248
No need to apologize.

474
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:18,799
All right, well, I got to
go run lines with Noir.

475
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:21,719
Scene 48 tonight. Real megillah.

476
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,304
Something wrong?

477
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:24,930
No. Nothing.

478
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:26,515
You sure?

479
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:28,851
Why would anything be wrong?

480
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,690
By the way, I went to the Tower,

481
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:36,692
and, uh, you weren't there.

482
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:39,153
No one had seen you.

483
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:41,071
So you're checking on me?

484
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,034
Wanted to see how your meeting went.

485
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,621
Hold on.

486
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:50,664
- Let me...
- Explain?

487
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,085
Come on now.

488
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:58,380
Why would you need to
explain anything to me?

If that's not an animal,
then what is, huh?

657
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,423
I didn't know!

658
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:14,598
I didn't know they were
gonna be in that bed.

659
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:17,309
It was supposed to be your boss.

660
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,944
Then they started screaming.

661
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:37,412
But it was too late.

662
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:42,209
So what, are we supposed
to feel bad for you now?

663
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,835
Fuck you.

664
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:45,597
I don't want anything from you.

665
00:41:45,598 --> 00:41:46,891
But you...

666
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:50,884
I saw you following me that night.

667
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:56,223
And then you disappeared.

668
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:59,309
I keep asking myself, why...

669
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:02,479
why didn't you stop me?

670
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:10,946
Why didn't you?

671
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:13,406
Good question.

672
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:27,087
All right, all right.

673
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:39,474
Cherie, this is not...

674
00:42:39,516 --> 00:42:40,892
He's dying!

675
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:42,936
- Quoi ?
- Jay!

676
00:42:42,978 --> 00:42:44,020
He's OD'ing.

677
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,689
I-I don't know what he took.

678
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,570
- Take him to the hospital!
- Please, come now!

679
00:42:47,571 --> 00:42:49,281
Come!

680
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:54,197
Serge, you fucking come right now.

681
00:42:55,991 --> 00:42:57,033
Cherie!

682
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:59,077
Hello...

683
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,341
No.

684
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:14,551
Come on!

685
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,595
Come on, mon ami!

686
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,393
Oh!

687
00:43:23,435 --> 00:43:25,312
Look at me, look at me, you went out.

688
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:26,896
Okay, can you sit?

689
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,356
Come on!

690
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:29,941
Come on, mon ami, come on.

691
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:33,320
He's okay.

692
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:35,655
Okay, you stay with him.

693
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:37,657
- You keep him talking, okay?
- What?

694
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:40,118
Where are you going?

695
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,536
Don't let him fall asleep.

696
00:43:41,578 --> 00:43:43,178
- What...?
- I told you I have something.

697
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:44,619
Something more important than this?

698
00:43:44,637 --> 00:43:45,707
More important than us?

699
00:43:45,749 --> 00:43:47,792
Cherie, I cannot do this right now.

700
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:50,253
Okay?

701
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:53,381
Please, stay with him!

702
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:55,091
Fine, you want to go...

703
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,885
go.

704
00:43:56,926 --> 00:43:59,763
We don't give a shit.

705
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:02,223
Serge?

706
00:44:12,442 --> 00:44:14,444
I'll be back.

707
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:21,326
Je te promets.

708
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:25,872
He's burning up.

709
00:44:25,914 --> 00:44:27,540
I'm going as fast as I can.

710
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:34,214
I appreciate what you done back there.

711
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:35,632
Oh, thanks.

712
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,634
Your approval means everything to me.

713
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,594
And some sarcasm to stick the landing.

714
00:44:39,636 --> 00:44:40,678
Nice one.

715
00:44:43,098 --> 00:44:44,724
You didn't have a choice.

716
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:51,272
You know what I was thinking,
when I was looking at him?

717
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:57,278
"Why'd you pull a gun, you stupid fuck?"

718
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,697
That's all.

719
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:05,578
Maybe once I would've
cried over him, but...

720
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:09,249
now he was just another
person in our way.

721
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:16,840
No.

722
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:18,758
- No what?
- No to that

723
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,429
fucking look of quiet respect

724
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,389
or approval or whatever that is.

725
00:45:24,431 --> 00:45:26,599
I don't want it.

726
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:31,729
We're nothing alike.

727
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:33,773
Nothing.

728
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:51,082
You really think that's gonna work?

729
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:53,460
I think so.

730
00:46:02,469 --> 00:46:04,721
You know, they're not
trying to make Supes here.

731
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,598
These people are test subjects.

732
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,266
They're trying to stabilize the V.

733
00:46:08,308 --> 00:46:09,642
Explain.

734
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:12,187
Infants handle it best, but adults?

735
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:14,468
I mean, you saw what happens...
sometimes you get powers,

736
00:46:14,469 --> 00:46:16,816
sometimes you get a freak,
sometimes you just explode.

737
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:19,319
Vought is trying to stabilize it,

738
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,571
so that you put the V in any adult arm,

739
00:46:21,613 --> 00:46:24,782
anywhere, anytime, you get
a solid Supe, solid powers.

740
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:27,160
Putain.

741
00:46:27,202 --> 00:46:29,621
Okay, so...

742
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:32,790
a thousand more Supes... 100,000?

743
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:34,709
Why? Why would Vought do that?

744
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,911
It's gonna fuck up their
movies, their merchandising...

745
00:46:36,912 --> 00:46:38,838
They don't tell me.

746
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,342
They just make me burn the evidence.

747
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:44,928
Okay?

748
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:58,983
My, uh...

749
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:01,444
my best friend

750
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:04,239
OD'd and I left

751
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,699
to save him that night.

752
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:10,328
Why I didn't stop you.

753
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:12,455
You were at a party.

754
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:14,958
I was away for 30 minutes.

755
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:17,919
Came back, you were gone.

756
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:23,800
Did he live?

757
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,843
Your friend?

758
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:30,390
Oui.

759
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:34,102
But I never saw him again, and...

760
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,521
then, uh, he died a few months later.

761
00:47:36,563 --> 00:47:38,147
Another overdose.

762
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:39,482
Are you serious?

763
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:41,359
Frenchie, wh...?

764
00:47:41,401 --> 00:47:43,653
Why didn't you ever tell us?

765
00:47:43,695 --> 00:47:46,614
What difference would it make?

766
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:48,825
After all these years, man?

767
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,995
We would've let you off the hook.

768
00:47:56,165 --> 00:48:00,336
What makes you think I want
to be let off the hook, huh?

769
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:21,357
Get it off me!

770
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:22,900
Get this thing off of me!

771
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,506
Was that...?

772
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:47,467
It's okay.

773
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:50,386
That's his fucking dick.

774
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:53,056
Don't be so closed-minded.

775
00:49:22,752 --> 00:49:24,472
I thought you said that
shit was gonna work.

776
00:49:24,473 --> 00:49:25,808
I said I thought it would.

777
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:45,108
Lamplighter?!

778
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:51,489
Lamplighter!

779
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:58,496
I'm here.

780
00:50:07,422 --> 00:50:11,008
I just killed six subjects out there

781
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:13,636
like a fucking teddy bear picnic.

782
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:16,139
What the hell happened?

783
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:23,688
Dr. Carlton got the propofol dose

784
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:25,481
wrong again.

785
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:28,276
So Cindy got loose,
freed some of the others.

786
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:30,278
I'm sure some of them
got out before lockdown.

787
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:31,696
Where's Dr. Carlton?

788
00:50:31,738 --> 00:50:33,948
Uh, he's in the cafeteria

789
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:36,200
and the hallway and...

790
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:38,077
some of the walls.

791
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:47,044
Clean up this mess.

792
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:50,089
I'm gonna go see if
anyone else got loose.

793
00:50:50,131 --> 00:50:52,550
Yes, ma'am.

794
00:51:05,897 --> 00:51:07,690
We need help!

795
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:19,702
What'd they say?

796
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:23,998
Just needs a couple of days for
the Cefazolin to kick in, but...

797
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,416
he should be all right.

798
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:27,210
We don't have a couple of days.

799
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:29,587
Well, we're gonna have to risk it.

800
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,850
Jesus.

801
00:51:43,893 --> 00:51:45,019
What?

802
00:51:45,061 --> 00:51:46,270
Just...

803
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:48,648
it's the kids' shampoo he uses.

804
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:50,483
I can smell it.

805
00:51:50,525 --> 00:51:53,528
L'Oréal for kids, strawberry smoothie.

806
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:55,446
I seen the bottle.

807
00:51:55,488 --> 00:51:57,740
Hateful shit.

808
00:51:57,782 --> 00:52:00,576
And his Axe Body Spray.

809
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:02,453
Ugh! I mean...

810
00:52:02,495 --> 00:52:04,914
that's how Vin Diesel must smell.

811
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:10,002
You know, every morning
he slathers his bum

812
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:11,879
- with creamy Desitin.
- No.

813
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:14,465
I fucking swear to God.
He's got rashes down there.

814
00:52:14,507 --> 00:52:16,551
I don't want to know that!

815
00:52:16,592 --> 00:52:19,637
Fucking mental, that's all I'm saying.

816
00:52:21,222 --> 00:52:23,432
Hmm.

817
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:27,270
But he really just...

818
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:30,606
never gives up on you, does he?

819
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:32,149
Aye.

820
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:36,112
And he follows you around
like a right little pup.

821
00:52:38,948 --> 00:52:42,410
He's too good for either of us.

822
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:44,912
Mm.

823
00:52:44,954 --> 00:52:47,665
Yeah.

824
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:51,377
I'm gonna Postmate Sugarfish.

825
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:53,796
What?

826
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:55,381
I'm gonna Postmate Sugarfish.

827
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:57,023
- Where's your phone?
- I can't hear you.

828
00:52:57,024 --> 00:52:58,776
Where's...?

829
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:22,241
Homelander and Queen Maeve.

830
00:53:22,283 --> 00:53:24,160
Oh, my God, they're leaving us.

831
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,651
- What's gonna happen?
- It's okay, everybody.

832
00:53:28,652 --> 00:53:29,652
- It's okay.
- Hey,

833
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:31,918
did you say Sugarfish?

834
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:35,504
Please save us!

835
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:37,757
- Take these two!
- No, no.

836
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:39,967
- Just these two! Please!
- No! What, so they can tell

837
00:53:40,009 --> 00:53:42,470
the world we left the rest
of them to fucking die?

838
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:43,971
- No.
- Elena.

839
00:53:44,013 --> 00:53:46,891
- Take my daughter!
- Help us!

840
00:53:46,933 --> 00:53:48,733
- You got to help us!
- Don't leave us!

841
00:53:48,734 --> 00:53:49,734
Please!

842
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:52,980
I love you.

843
00:53:53,022 --> 00:53:55,566
Tell the boys I love them.

844
00:53:57,026 --> 00:53:59,695
I'm gonna show that to Homelander.

845
00:54:01,364 --> 00:54:02,990
And...

846
00:54:03,032 --> 00:54:05,993
he's either gonna leave us alone

847
00:54:06,035 --> 00:54:08,287
or I'm gonna put it on CNN.

848
00:54:12,488 --> 00:54:13,788
Elena.

849
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:16,253
Elena.

850
00:54:16,295 --> 00:54:18,631
This is our out.

851
00:54:22,051 --> 00:54:24,470
I was scared. I...

852
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:30,434
I know I should have stood up to him.

853
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:32,019
I know that.

854
00:54:32,061 --> 00:54:36,065
Elena, I watched a
plane full of people die.

855
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:45,449
Why are you looking at me like that?

856
00:54:48,911 --> 00:54:51,122
Yeah. Right.

857
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:52,206
Yo.

858
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:54,417
Close stitch, but Hughie's okay.

859
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:55,584
Oh, bien.

860
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:57,169
Hey,

861
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:59,755
tell Butcher about the thick
penis around your neck.

862
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:01,173
Fuck you.

863
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:03,843
Nah, nah, nah, it's just
Frenchie being Frenchie.

864
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:16,522
I am sorry.

865
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:22,903
For a long time,

866
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:26,866
I was trying to save you.

867
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,702
I thought, uh,

868
00:55:29,744 --> 00:55:31,454
if I did, somehow,

869
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:35,791
that would make up
for the things I've done.

870
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:41,130
You never asked to be saved.

871
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:47,303
You cannot absolve my, uh, sins.

872
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:50,389
No one can.

873
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:53,142
I know this now.

874
00:55:53,184 --> 00:55:56,353
So...

875
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:58,314
I leave you alone.

876
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,082
Got to go.

877
00:56:25,174 --> 00:56:27,384
Colonel.

878
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:28,886
Marvin,

879
00:56:28,928 --> 00:56:31,138
where is he?

880
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,182
This way.

881
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:38,104
Madame Mallory.

882
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:41,107
Uh, I know I wasn't
welcome at the funeral,

883
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:44,318
so, all these years, I couldn't
offer my condolences...

884
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,403
Where is he?

885
00:56:53,244 --> 00:56:55,204
Why isn't this man restrained?

886
00:56:55,246 --> 00:56:56,622
No need. I wanted to come.

887
00:56:56,664 --> 00:57:00,209
I don't want to hear a single
goddamn word from you.

888
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:07,019
I thought this was behind me.

889
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:09,022
But it's not.

890
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:13,180
It never is.

891
00:57:13,222 --> 00:57:15,975
Then let's both be done with it.

892
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:21,605
I know what you have to do.

893
00:57:23,983 --> 00:57:25,860
Do it.

894
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:27,862
You'd be doing me a favor.

895
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:29,321
Do it.

896
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:33,159
Madame, please.

897
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,619
If I may?

898
00:57:36,871 --> 00:57:38,247
Besides you,

899
00:57:38,289 --> 00:57:40,332
no one wanted him dead more than me,

900
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:42,585
but I am begging you for his life.

901
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:51,677
I have no choice.

902
00:57:52,887 --> 00:57:55,848
It won't help you.

903
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:59,560
All you'd be doing is
ending his torment.

904
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:06,984
You cannot punish him as
much as he punishes himself.

905
00:58:09,737 --> 00:58:12,031
Trust me.

906
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:17,286
So...

907
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:21,707
what exactly

908
00:58:21,749 --> 00:58:25,252
are you proposing we do with him?

909
00:58:32,593 --> 00:58:34,261
Hey.

910
00:58:35,596 --> 00:58:37,389
I'm so glad you're here.

911
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:38,807
I want to apologize.

912
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:40,309
Please, just let me explain.

913
00:58:40,351 --> 00:58:44,855
Flap, flap, flap goes
that little mouth of yours.

914
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:50,694
You remember you told me
that you don't break easily?

915
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:54,782
Well, I've been thinking about that.

916
00:58:57,326 --> 00:58:59,161
A lot.

917
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:03,165
I will never lie to you again.

918
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:05,918
I will tell you everything.

919
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:14,385
Starting with this.

920
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:39,243
Your grandmother?

921
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,830
My daughter.

922
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:49,628
Chloe. She died of
Alzheimer's a few years ago.

923
00:59:51,964 --> 00:59:53,507
How old are you?

924
00:59:53,549 --> 00:59:56,593
I was born in 1919.

925
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:58,137
In Berlin.

926
01:00:10,441 --> 01:00:12,526
Is that you with...?

927
01:00:12,568 --> 01:00:14,528
Heinrich Himmler.

928
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:16,447
He was a lovely dancer.

929
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:18,824
And that's Goebbels.

930
01:00:18,866 --> 01:00:20,576
And...

931
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:23,954
the most important man in the room...

932
01:00:35,174 --> 01:00:37,634
Frederick Vought.

933
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:44,016
He gave me the first
successful V injection.

934
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:47,227
He taught me everything.

935
01:00:48,604 --> 01:00:49,980
And then we fell in love,

936
01:00:50,022 --> 01:00:51,315
and he gave me a daughter.

937
01:00:51,357 --> 01:00:53,942
He made me,

938
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:57,404
and his genius made you.

939
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:10,584
Frederick didn't care about
all the fans or stardom

940
01:01:10,626 --> 01:01:13,587
or any of that shallow bullshit.

941
01:01:13,629 --> 01:01:17,508
We are in a war for the culture.

942
01:01:17,549 --> 01:01:20,511
The other races are grinding us down

943
01:01:20,552 --> 01:01:22,346
and taking what is rightfully ours,

944
01:01:22,388 --> 01:01:24,765
but we can fight back.

945
01:01:24,807 --> 01:01:26,934
With an army of supermen,

946
01:01:26,975 --> 01:01:29,269
millions strong.

947
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:33,023
Because that is Vought's true destiny.

948
01:01:33,065 --> 01:01:37,903
And you will be the
man who will lead us.

949
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:47,454
You are everything that we dreamed of.

950
01:01:50,249 --> 01:01:53,919
So I love you with all of my heart.

951
01:01:55,003 --> 01:01:57,673
How could I not?

952
01:02:03,011 --> 01:02:06,640
Everyone I have ever
loved is in the ground.

953
01:02:06,682 --> 01:02:09,435
And then I found you.

954
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,980
We found each other.

955
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:16,358
And now neither of us

956
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,777
has to be alone ever again.

957
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,281
And that...

958
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:24,908
is the truth.
