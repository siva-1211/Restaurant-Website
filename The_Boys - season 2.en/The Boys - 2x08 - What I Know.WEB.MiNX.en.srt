2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,509
Okay, this is insane.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,470
We need more Compound V!

4
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:14,098
- Absolutely.
- We need more Supes!

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,740
More Supes! More Supes!

6
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:18,018
More Supes! More Supes! More Supes!

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,269
More Supes! More Supes!

8
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,354
Come with me.

9
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:22,148
What are you doing here?

10
00:00:23,192 --> 00:00:24,472
But on the bright side,

11
00:00:24,473 --> 00:00:25,651
I'm sleeping in a basement

12
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,954
beneath a pawnshop in East Flatbush.

13
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:29,197
We never wanted that for you.

14
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:31,698
We all just have Ryan's
best interests at heart.

15
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:32,783
I want us to be a family.

16
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:34,425
They just flew me up and showed me.

17
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:36,667
This house is fake, the
neighbors are fake, you're fake.

18
00:00:36,668 --> 00:00:38,414
No, Ryan!

19
00:00:38,456 --> 00:00:40,336
You have five minutes to
make your opening st...

20
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,015
There's a supervillain
on your school campus.

21
00:00:57,016 --> 00:00:58,934
You hear the calls of distress.

22
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:01,144
You witness a violent
display of superpowers.

23
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:02,229
What do you do?

24
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:04,106
I'm Sheriff Ed Flanagan,

25
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:06,776
and I'm here with Homelander
to talk about school safety.

26
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,320
On the first report of
an active supervillain,

27
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,864
a hero will immediately
rush to your campus.

28
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:14,241
But to stay alive in
the moment, remember,

29
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:17,453
stay calm and follow the law.

30
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:20,122
Lock all doors and windows.

31
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:24,835
Arm yourselves.

32
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:27,505
Your teacher should have
an authorized firearm.

33
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:32,718
But use whatever you can.

34
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:37,223
And wait for a hero.

35
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:42,311
Unfortunately,

36
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:44,063
the possibility that you will experience

37
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,857
a supervillain attack grows
more likely every day.

38
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:49,360
But by having an action plan,
you can dramatically increase

39
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:50,861
your chances of survival.

40
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:54,114
And survival is all that matters.

41
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:59,954
- Jody, where's my flag pin?
- How should I know?

42
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:02,331
Well, I can't go to this
thing without a flag pin.

43
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:04,917
Bob, before he makes any decisions,

44
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,418
- just let me talk to him.
- One,

45
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,170
the president doesn't like you.

46
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:10,214
He used the word "standoffish".

47
00:02:10,256 --> 00:02:12,258
And, two, he's decided.

48
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,301
He's declaring a national emergency,

49
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,678
bypassing the FDA,

50
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,722
and authorizing Compound V
for use by law enforcement

51
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,604
- and first responders.
- Wait, Robert.

52
00:02:20,605 --> 00:02:22,601
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- I wish I were.

53
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,895
Doses are going for five million a pop.

54
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:26,522
Pentagon's got a big order in,

55
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:28,607
and ICE is next in line.

56
00:02:28,609 --> 00:02:30,209
You can't release V into the mainstream.

57
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,070
We're talking an avalanche
of Supes; it's suicide.

58
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:35,698
In one hour, I will be standing
at the memorial service

59
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,450
for the fallen heroes
of the House attack,

60
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,952
with my flag pin,

61
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:42,872
giving my thoughts and
prayers, and pledging

62
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,790
to keep America safe.

63
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:47,084
The best way to do that
is with Compound V.

64
00:02:47,086 --> 00:02:48,926
Yeah, we know. We were there. Remember?

65
00:02:48,927 --> 00:02:50,796
Covered in my chief of staff's brains.

66
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,923
Look, there was no
terrorist. It was Vought.

67
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:55,009
It's a fucking coup.

68
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,220
- A bunch of their guys died, too.
- To cover their own tracks.

69
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:02,141
For the record, I agree with you.

70
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,684
And I hate this.

71
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:06,020
But you've got no proof.

72
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,688
Folks are scared.

73
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,274
If Vought took a shit in
the middle of Fifth Avenue,

74
00:03:10,276 --> 00:03:11,636
they'd throw a ticker-tape parade.

75
00:03:11,637 --> 00:03:15,029
- Here's what we do have, Bob.
- Oh, let me guess.

76
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,822
A tape of me fucking my kids' nanny

77
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,324
at her daughter's quinceañera?

78
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,285
Release it. Please. I'm begging you.

79
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:25,039
A plum gig at Fox, and this
shithole in my rearview?

80
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,141
Sounds dreamy.

81
00:03:26,142 --> 00:03:28,125
Okay, what if we got
hard proof? A witness.

82
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:29,251
Anything.

83
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:31,587
If you could get Jesus Christ himself,

84
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:34,840
or maybe Homelander in
front of a camera, sure.

85
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:36,842
I really am sorry.

86
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,506
I'm nervous about driving in the city.

87
00:04:15,507 --> 00:04:16,547
You'll be okay.

88
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,550
- The plan again?
- Okay,

89
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,135
drive straight to Gen's in Sedona,

90
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:23,222
cash for gasoline, no hotels.

91
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,224
I don't want to leave you here.

92
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,101
I'll be fine.

93
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,732
The anxious boy? Really?
With the moist handshake?

94
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,193
- Mom, come on.
- Okay. Okay.

95
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:37,653
Um...

96
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:39,113
you need a new one.

97
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,407
I...

98
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,702
I'm not gonna wear it.

99
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:48,580
I don't care if you wear it.
I just want you to have it.

100
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,670
I love you.

101
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:56,380
I love you, too.

102
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:00,217
You be safe.

103
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:01,677
Okay.

104
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,390
Hey.

105
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:09,018
- What's going on?
- They've lost their minds.

106
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:13,105
The RPG releases an
electromagnetic pulse on impact.

107
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:15,010
Should cut through
Stormfront's plasma bolts.

108
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:16,041
How sure are you?

109
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,276
It's a guesstimate.

110
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,445
So that's Stormfront.

111
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,697
And thanks to Starlight,
we know that Noir

112
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:23,032
needs only a fuckin' tree nut.

113
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,116
How about A-Train?

114
00:05:24,138 --> 00:05:25,658
Got enough epinephrine here to blow up

115
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:26,699
that motherfucker's heart.

116
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:28,370
Hey, we can't just kill everyone.

117
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:31,123
That is exactly what we're gonna do.

118
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:32,207
Listen, you heard Mallory.

119
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,959
She said all we need is another witness.

120
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,711
Wile E. Coyote.

121
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,172
Always chases Roadrunner,

122
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,841
always with an elaborate
plan, always fails.

123
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:43,302
You know, I always say,
"Why do this, Coyote?

124
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,889
All you need is an AR-15,
and 'meep-meep' no more".

125
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,348
Exactly. See?

126
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,851
We're just gonna shoot
Roadrunner in the fucking head.

127
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:53,854
That won't stop Vought.
That-that won't stop Compound V.

128
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:55,189
If you kill these Supes,

129
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,030
then Vought's just gonna
make a thousand more.

130
00:05:57,031 --> 00:05:58,711
Yeah, and we're gonna
top those cunts, too.

131
00:05:58,712 --> 00:05:59,726
Great.

132
00:05:59,768 --> 00:06:02,780
So that's settled. We're just
supervillains now, huh?

133
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,261
Vought attacked the country, Hughie.

134
00:06:04,262 --> 00:06:05,471
Fuck 'em all.

135
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,620
What if I testify?

136
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,164
Escaped convicts don't
have a ton of credibility.

137
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:17,586
No, but maybe I know someone who does.

138
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,797
Give us the day.

139
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,383
Hughie?

140
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,803
See you later.

141
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:28,889
Officials are still trying to
determine the perpetrator

142
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:31,266
of the capital attack, the
Department of Homeland Security

143
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:34,478
has issued a crimson terror alert.

144
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,939
In Washington, all
government buildings...

145
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,566
- How's Noir?
- Unresponsive.

146
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,128
They don't think there's brain damage,

147
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,028
but apparently it's hard to tell.

148
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,280
So, Noir's a vegetable,

149
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,865
Lamplighter's a charcoal briquette,

150
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,787
Starlight's in the breeze
somewhere, and you're,

151
00:06:48,788 --> 00:06:50,410
- what, fine with it?
- Yes.

152
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,621
Because none of that matters
anymore because of this.

153
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:55,791
So far, no terrorist group
has claimed responsibility.

154
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,918
All right, so,

155
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,253
you didn't do this.

156
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,797
I wish I'd killed Vogelbaum.

157
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,966
- But no, it wasn't me.
- Right.

158
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,927
And there's no supervillains
on American soil.

159
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:09,346
- None that we know of.
- And that means...

160
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,891
...it's Edgar.

161
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,519
Maybe. I mean, he is pretty smart,

162
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:17,062
especially for his kind.

163
00:07:17,064 --> 00:07:18,664
...Compound V to members of the military

164
00:07:18,665 --> 00:07:19,731
and law enforcement.

165
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,693
Hey, smile.

166
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,319
This is good news.

167
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:28,949
Yes, there have been sacrifices,
but we are this close

168
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:32,077
to no more premieres or paparazzi,

169
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:36,707
or screaming fans, or any
of that dancing monkey shit.

170
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,988
We have to make sure that
the right people get the doses,

171
00:07:38,989 --> 00:07:42,212
but it is a whole new world.

172
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,381
What about the wrong people?

173
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:45,799
Couple of billion of them.

174
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:48,218
They're not just gonna sit there.

175
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,470
Don't worry, silly.

176
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,890
Frederick had a solution for everything.

177
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,314
Okay,

178
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:01,982
there's something really important

179
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:03,650
that I've been meaning to ask you.

180
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,529
Last I checked, you
are not 57 years old,

181
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:12,242
so, come on, why is it
always, always Billy Joel?

182
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:14,203
I'm 57 on the inside.

183
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,829
No, really. Please.

184
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,666
It was just the music
in my house growing up.

185
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,828
You know, I did some somersaults
to "You May Be Right"

186
00:08:21,829 --> 00:08:25,380
that were pretty thrilling to watch.

187
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:29,259
♪ Only the good die young... ♪

188
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:32,179
Butcher is right, you know.

189
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:35,515
We've already tried to take
Vought down the right way.

190
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,935
This isn't gonna work; this is
not gonna stop Compound V

191
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,854
- from getting out there.
- So it's hopeless?

192
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:43,982
Just kill 'em all, let God sort 'em out?

193
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,192
I mean...

194
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:49,780
Then why are you even helping me?

195
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,450
Why did you save me at the Tower?

196
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,410
They were... they were gonna hurt you.

197
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,704
Yeah, but, Hughie, you could
have gotten yourself killed.

198
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,123
I mean, after the way
that I treated you,

199
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:03,043
you had every reason to give up on me.

200
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:05,379
So why didn't you?

201
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,880
♪ Only the good die young... ♪

202
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:11,468
I just... would never.

203
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,347
That's why I'm helping.

204
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,445
You were stupid to text.

205
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:33,657
Everyone's looking for you.

206
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:35,534
Where's Elena?

207
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,244
This is the guy?

208
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,290
Uh, I'm sorry...

209
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,709
Hi. Hughie.

210
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,503
He's even more of a
twink than in the photo.

211
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,173
I could split that shit
like dry firewood.

212
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,510
Big fan.

213
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,846
I need to ask you something.

214
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,724
It's a lot.

215
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:03,478
- I need you to testify.
- Testify?

216
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,480
On the record.

217
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:08,442
Against Vought, against Homelander,

218
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,235
Stormfront, everything.

219
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,112
Why would I do that?

220
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:16,158
Because things are really bad, and...

221
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,369
...you're our last chance.

222
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,580
- Pass.
- Look, I get

223
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,124
- that it's dangerous.
- It's suicide.

224
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,459
But that's not the reason.

225
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,210
Well, then, what is?

226
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:29,880
I'm tired.

227
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:33,133
We're all tired.

228
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:35,135
But they're hurting people.

229
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:37,417
And sooner or later, they're
gonna hurt someone you love.

230
00:10:37,418 --> 00:10:38,836
Am I talking to you?

231
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:41,725
Look.

232
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:50,776
I get that it's easier to just disappear

233
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,027
inside of yourself.

234
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:54,279
Trust me, it's all I want to do.

235
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,114
But we can't, Maeve.

236
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,575
We can't.

237
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,452
This is a war now,

238
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,871
- and we...
- Shut the fuck up.

239
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:04,915
Christ, you...

240
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,376
Haven't I done enough for you?

241
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,256
Didn't I save your fucking life?

242
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:19,429
It doesn't matter what
we do, nothing changes.

243
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:28,855
Nothing ever changes or gets better.

244
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:35,070
And I'm tired.

245
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,782
Just leave.

246
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:43,078
Go! Take your fucking twink

247
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,664
and get the fuck out of here!

248
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,750
Okay.

249
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,794
Come on.

250
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,185
Monsieur Charcuter, we need you.

251
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,437
Now.

252
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,525
He said he lives under a
pawnshop in East Flatbush!

253
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,569
- He has to be here.
- Hey. Let her in.

254
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,363
Fucking help me... Billy.

255
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,616
They took him.

256
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:22,868
They have Ryan.

257
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,578
Who's got him?

258
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,250
I appreciate you coming
all this way, Stan.

259
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:33,336
Well, I can't exactly be seen

260
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:36,756
with you at the Tower now, can I?

261
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,258
- Fresca?
- No.

262
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,968
Thank you. Awful stuff.

263
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:45,265
So, you've had a chance
to look over our proposal?

264
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:48,518
He publicly confessed to
a sexual assault, Alastair.

265
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,080
And we've made a substantial investment

266
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:51,771
in the Deep's rehabilitation.

267
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:55,317
Our internal research bureau
shows an impressive Q rating.

268
00:12:55,358 --> 00:13:00,197
He's an asset to Vought
in these troubled times.

269
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:03,575
Oh. What sort of commission is
the Church getting these days?

270
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,785
40%? 50?

271
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,579
Sounds like you're
open to reinstatement.

272
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:08,914
That's fantastic.

273
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,375
What about A-Train?

274
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:15,629
You do need a speedster,
since Shockwave exploded.

275
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,838
Harder sell.

276
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,841
One has-been back is redemption.

277
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:22,344
Two is weakness.

278
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,179
Stormfront has problems with him.

279
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:27,599
And at the moment,
I have to indulge her.

280
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:30,185
What's her problem with A-Train?

281
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:33,396
I understand that she was
among your grandfather's

282
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:37,484
first followers back when
the Collective was a start-up.

283
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:41,530
I can neither confirm nor deny that.

284
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:47,994
Then your internal research
bureau knows exactly

285
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,664
what Stormfront's
problem is with A-Train.

286
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,959
Deep is still a win.

287
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,002
Shall I have Business Affairs reach out?

288
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:58,046
- Please do.
- Let me walk you out.

289
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,395
Sons of bitches.

290
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:17,732
Okay, yeah.

291
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:21,194
Voilà. Uh, jambon-beurre.

292
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:23,154
Simple, but it's the
ingredients, you know?

293
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,996
- Thank you.
- Diet Coke

294
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,783
with Lime, right?

295
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:29,411
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

296
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:30,829
We've heard a lot about you.

297
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:35,792
Uh, I'm sorry, I-I wish

298
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,377
I could say the same.

299
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,796
Uh, you all close with Billy?

300
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,715
Yeah.

301
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,342
I mean... sure.

302
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,137
- Why the hesitation?
- Well...

303
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:50,890
Let's just say he ain't really
close to a lot of people.

304
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:53,935
You know? Well, except you, of course.

305
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:55,937
I'm close to him.

306
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:57,551
- I am.
- All right, all right, lads,

307
00:14:57,552 --> 00:14:58,773
let's give her some air, eh?

308
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,442
Yeah.

309
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,903
So, Ryan ain't on any
of their social media,

310
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,740
which is good on one hand,
but it don't help us none.

311
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,825
- So, you think he's in the Tower?
- Not sure.

312
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,994
You stay here.

313
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:14,539
Rest up. I'm gonna go
do a little digging.

314
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,000
Hey, Billy.

315
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,587
I'm sorry, okay?

316
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:22,213
I have no right to ask you to help me

317
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,632
after what I said to you, but...

318
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,968
Look, don't you worry, all right?

319
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,220
I will find your son.

320
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,602
Thank you.

321
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,526
Fuck off, you lot.

322
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,367
What is it, Samantha?

323
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,661
Mr. Edgar, normally,

324
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,462
I wouldn't put this through,
but the man says

325
00:15:54,463 --> 00:15:56,206
it's life or death, and you'd know him.

326
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:57,666
What's his name?

327
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,209
William Butcher.

328
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:02,879
Hi, hi.

329
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:04,673
We've been having a
super fun time in here.

330
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,467
I've just been googling all the
names of the cats in "Cats".

331
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,761
Can you believe Ryan
has never seen "Cats"?

332
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,596
What happened to your hair?

333
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,598
- Oh, nothing.
- Hey, buddy.

334
00:16:13,617 --> 00:16:15,057
Sorry we had to leave you all alone.

335
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:17,644
Dad's work can sometimes
get pretty crazy.

336
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:19,479
He hasn't been alone.

337
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,898
I've been here. I got him
all these dipping sauces.

338
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,275
You didn't want to play
"Vought Tournament of Heroes"?

339
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,527
I'm the main guy.

340
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,779
I was working on my states.

341
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:31,074
- Uh, states?
- Well, yeah, I write down all 50 states

342
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:34,452
as fast as I can in
either alphabetical order

343
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,079
or geographical order.

344
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:38,164
You're giving yourself homework?

345
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,834
Well, Mom says that
learning is a gift, so...

346
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,837
Mm-hmm. That mom of yours,

347
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,965
she sure does have
some cute little sayings.

348
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,594
Do you think maybe I could call her?

349
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:53,930
Uh...

350
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,894
Hey, Ryan.

351
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,146
Ugh.

352
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,942
I get it. I would feel lonely,
too, if I was cooped up

353
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:09,821
all day by myself in this
West Elm Death Star.

354
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,658
- Mm-hmm.
- How about

355
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,660
we take a field trip?

356
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,495
What do you say, Dad?

357
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:20,874
Welcome to Planet Vought.

358
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:23,001
Have a super day.

359
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:28,006
Let's give a warm hero's welcome

360
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,527
to Kashden, who's turning five today.

361
00:17:29,528 --> 00:17:31,009
Welcome to Planet Vought.

362
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,469
Would you like to try our new

363
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,638
Brave Maeve Rainbow Veggie Burger?

364
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,599
Holy shit.

365
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:44,647
There you go, Maestro.

366
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:49,194
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Yeah.

367
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,196
Hey.

368
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,615
Wait until you try the
Big Homey with bacon.

369
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,450
It's so good.

370
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:58,186
And-and the, uh, and
the Mocha Noir Shake?

371
00:17:58,228 --> 00:17:59,268
It's amazing.

372
00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:01,389
And it won't be lumpy like your mom's.

373
00:18:01,431 --> 00:18:02,765
Homelander?

374
00:18:02,807 --> 00:18:04,292
Hey.

375
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:07,837
- Can I get a selfie?
- Ask the boss.

376
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,464
Kidding. Of course you can.

377
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:12,217
- Of course you can.
- Stormfront? I-I love you.

378
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,968
- Can I get a self... a selfie?
- Oh, sure.

379
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,286
One at a time.

380
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:16,929
- Homelander.
- Kids first.

381
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:17,930
I'm a huge fan.

382
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,531
- Can I get a picture?
- It's Homelander!

383
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,225
- All right. Hey!
- I love you! Homelander!

384
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:23,186
- Homelander!
- Hey, guys...

385
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:29,317
I want to go home.

386
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:35,490
Hey. You okay?

387
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:36,866
I want my mom.

388
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:40,286
Okay, I got you. I got you.

389
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,497
Thank you, everyone. Excuse me.

390
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,625
Thank you. Excuse me. Excuse me.

391
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:48,837
Stay back, please. Please,
please, please. Just stay back.

392
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,089
Stay back. Thank you.

393
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,402
- New bling?
- Mm-hmm.

394
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:59,222
Donna got it for me.

395
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:01,516
Pretty sure she got it at Duane Reade.

396
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,563
Oh, gosh. Moms.

397
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:11,234
The gift that keeps on giving, forever.

398
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,488
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

399
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,991
Wh... No, it's-it's fine.

400
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:20,410
No, no. I'm an asshole
for bitching about my mom

401
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,287
when yours is...

402
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,082
My mom's not dead.

403
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:27,917
She's not?

404
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:30,086
Oh, it's just, you never
mentioned her, so...

405
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:32,255
She left when I was six.

406
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:35,884
Oh, wow. Shit.

407
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,552
I'm really sorry.

408
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:42,974
That's where Billy Joel comes from.

409
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,643
She and I, we used to
have these dance parties.

410
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,062
She was, she was fun.

411
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:51,232
She made awesome Seven
costumes for Halloween.

412
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:57,196
And, uh, then one day, she just
left and never called again.

413
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,908
Not even a card.

414
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,910
You know, it was like
some silent alarm went off

415
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,579
and she was like, "Well...

416
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:07,457
fuck them, time to go".

417
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,792
No, I'm sure that that's not it.

418
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,711
What would you call it?

419
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:18,343
I guess that's why I always
just kind of hang in there,

420
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:22,013
no matter how bad it gets.

421
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:24,307
'Cause I...

422
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:26,684
I-I don't want to be like her.

423
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:32,649
That's kind of clingy
and pathetic, isn't it?

424
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,734
No. No.

425
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:36,653
It isn't.

426
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,279
At all.

427
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,408
What's up, shitbirds?

428
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,130
Jesus Christ!

429
00:20:45,219 --> 00:20:49,415
What the fuck?! What the fuck?!

430
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,250
- How did you find us?!
- Please.

431
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:53,132
I can cover the boroughs
in, like, three hours.

432
00:20:53,173 --> 00:20:54,383
I went looking, that's all.

433
00:20:54,424 --> 00:20:56,214
I'm surprised your heart can take it.

434
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,615
My heart is just fine. Take a
step closer and I'll show you.

435
00:20:58,657 --> 00:20:59,950
Hey, I saved your life,

436
00:20:59,991 --> 00:21:02,011
asshole. And now you're coming after us?

437
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:08,768
We're even now, bitch.

438
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,692
Holy shit!

439
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:17,610
Is this true?

440
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:19,732
Everything makes a little
more sense now, doesn't it?

441
00:21:19,733 --> 00:21:20,752
Where did you get this?

442
00:21:20,753 --> 00:21:22,699
I didn't get it. Okay? I was never here.

443
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,951
You got that shit on your own. Yeah?

444
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:26,786
But wh... why-why are you doing this?

445
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:28,121
'Cause I want back in.

446
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:30,623
So, I need her gone.

447
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:32,834
Fuck that Nazi bitch.

448
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:01,446
Would you ask Mario if he could whip up

449
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:04,240
some of those Gruyère puffs?

450
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,659
Would you like an order?
They're worth the cheat day.

451
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:11,164
I assume you got a man out
there, with a clean shot?

452
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:12,832
More than one.

453
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:14,514
Then I'll skip the
fucking hors d'oeuvres,

454
00:22:14,515 --> 00:22:17,170
if you don't mind, and we'll
just cut straight to it, yeah?

455
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,213
You mentioned on the
phone that you could help

456
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,132
with Homelander's son.

457
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:24,302
I must say, I'm not sure what you mean.

458
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,346
That boy is your only
possible contingency

459
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:29,348
against Homelander.

460
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,518
Now, that contingency don't work

461
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,146
if they're off playing
Ward and the Beav.

462
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:37,440
I can fix that.

463
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:42,236
Thank you, Alvin.

464
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:45,823
Homelander's a friend.

465
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,909
Why would I betray him?

466
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,661
Because you're a ruthless bastard.

467
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:54,540
That's hurtful.

468
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:56,125
You turned a racist piece of shite

469
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,127
into America's sweetheart.

470
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:00,379
What word would you use?

471
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:11,265
Stormfront's good at
making people angry.

472
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,976
Angry people want Compound V.

473
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:16,562
Compound V raises our stock price.

474
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:19,107
Look, I'd have preferred
V remained a secret,

475
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:22,068
but we play with the cards we're dealt.

476
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:25,404
It's not ruthless,
it's prices per share.

477
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:27,031
That's all.

478
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:30,034
Maybe you should take a
look in the mirror, mate.

479
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,161
'Cause that bitch should bother you.

480
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,705
Of course she does.

481
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,583
But it's not about me.

482
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,502
I can't lash out

483
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:43,381
like some raging, entitled maniac.

484
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,466
That's a white man's luxury.

485
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:50,388
So, it's just business, then, eh?

486
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,307
When, Mr. Butcher, in history,

487
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:56,394
has it ever been about
anything different?

488
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,230
And what makes you think

489
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:02,400
that you can control that racist bitch?

490
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,820
Look, I've got to get across town...

491
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:08,197
Look, I can get the boy away
from Homelander, all right?

492
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,907
How?

493
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,952
That's my business.

494
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:17,915
When I got him, I'll call your people,

495
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,500
they zero in on this cell signal,

496
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:21,669
and then come and scoop him up.

497
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:23,838
And then you do a better fucking job

498
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,464
of hiding him this time, yeah?

499
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:28,968
You have my word.

500
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,012
I will get Rebecca and
Ryan somewhere safe.

501
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,430
No.

502
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,891
Not Becca. Becca stays with me.

503
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:36,976
But that's the whole point.

504
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:39,270
That he's raised by his mother.

505
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:40,605
Find him a new fucking mum.

506
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:43,399
I'm taking my wife
back. That's the deal.

507
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:47,069
And what happens when Rebecca
shows up on my doorstep,

508
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:49,989
begging to be reunited with her boy?

509
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:55,369
You say it's the only way

510
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:58,414
you can guarantee Ryan's
protection from Homelander.

511
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:01,375
'Cause as you know,

512
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:04,754
a mother will do anything

513
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:07,006
to protect her son.

514
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:10,760
And you call me a ruthless bastard.

515
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,387
You tell me where he is...

516
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:16,307
...and I'll do the rest.

517
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:32,949
Where's Ryan?

518
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,326
He's, um, he's inside.

519
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:36,869
He doesn't want to talk.

520
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:38,996
- So, go in anyway.
- No, no, no, no. I've tried.

521
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,123
He... he wants to be left alone.

522
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:43,167
You are the strongest man in the world,

523
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:46,420
and you're scared of a little boy.

524
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:47,880
He's your blood.

525
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:50,549
Just talk to him.

526
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:52,593
Be the man I know you are.

527
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:57,431
New York. North Carolina.

528
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:01,060
North Dakota. Ohio.

529
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:05,314
Oklahoma. Oregon.

530
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:09,527
I'm sorry.

531
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,320
No, no, no, no. Buddy,

532
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:12,738
don't you be sorry.

533
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,490
I... I should've known better.

534
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:22,915
There were just... so many people.

535
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:24,959
Yeah, there was.

536
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:37,430
You know, I remember the
first time I was in a crowd.

537
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:39,473
Probably didn't bother you.

538
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:41,267
I was terrified.

539
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:44,020
All these people staring at me

540
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:46,063
and reaching out, trying to grab me,

541
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,690
and egging me on to use my powers.

542
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:51,819
I just... I felt like I was... drowning.

543
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:54,655
Well, what'd you do?

544
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:56,949
Well, I took off.

545
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:00,870
I flew away.

546
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:03,789
They found me 80 miles down the I-9.

547
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:05,708
Crying my little eyes out.

548
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:12,298
You? Cry?

549
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,511
Yes.

550
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:25,519
But I'm a man, so, not
in a long while. But...

551
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:28,230
who knows, maybe, uh...

552
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:30,900
maybe next time, you'll fly away.

553
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:33,944
Maybe... with me.

554
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:39,909
Look...

555
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,370
I know you want me to be like you.

556
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,163
But, Dad, I'm not.

557
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:52,380
Son...

558
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:56,300
I didn't just wake up one
day and fly out the door.

559
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:59,095
That's not how it works. I had to learn.

560
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:01,097
Only I didn't have anyone to teach me,

561
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:04,350
'cause the doctors that... um...

562
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:07,436
The people that raised me,

563
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:09,897
uh, were scared of me,

564
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:11,899
so they kept their distance.

565
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:15,194
And I had to figure it
all out by myself, see?

566
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:17,905
Well, you-you don't have
to go through any of that.

567
00:28:17,947 --> 00:28:19,907
I'll teach you.

568
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:21,700
Really?

569
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,162
I love you.

570
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:48,269
Hey, did you find anything?

571
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,272
They got him in a cabin up in Rochester.

572
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:54,400
- What?
- I mean... Becca!

573
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:56,986
She's great. We-we talked earlier.

574
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:58,946
And, um, she's-she's
really great. She's...

575
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:01,269
- You're really... you're great.
- All right, easy, tiger.

576
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:03,117
How'd you get on? I
guess you got fuck all?

577
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:06,537
No witnesses. But we
definitely found fuck all.

578
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:09,081
I'm not sure I'm using that
term properly, but, uh...

579
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:11,125
here.

580
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:15,171
Fuck me.

581
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:17,047
This is a jackpot.

582
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:19,758
Well done, you two.

583
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,969
This'll do nicely.

584
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:23,554
All right, listen up, you lot.

585
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:25,236
Getting the kid back,
it ain't your fight,

586
00:29:25,277 --> 00:29:26,877
and I ain't gonna ask you to come along.

587
00:29:26,878 --> 00:29:29,768
Lick my big black balls, Butcher.

588
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:30,978
Sorry, Becca.

589
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,563
You done asked us to lie,

590
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:36,108
spy, do all kinds of
fucked up shit for you.

591
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,402
Now we finally get a chance
to do something good,

592
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,446
and you think we're gonna
take a pass on that?

593
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:42,031
We're in.

594
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:43,699
Of course we're in.

595
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:47,036
All right.

596
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:49,622
Let's get a shift on.

597
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,361
What?

598
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:23,072
You remember the range at Fort Bragg?

599
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:25,366
I was a better shot than you.

600
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:28,994
Well, you had a bloody
good teacher, didn't you?

601
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:31,413
I like your friends.

602
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:33,874
Especially Hughie. He's, uh...

603
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:35,292
He's good for you.

604
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:39,880
Look, Becca... you ain't coming with us.

605
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:41,340
Bullshit.

606
00:30:41,382 --> 00:30:43,222
Ryan doesn't know you,
he'll never come to you.

607
00:30:43,264 --> 00:30:45,349
It's too dangerous, and I
ain't gonna lose you again.

608
00:30:45,391 --> 00:30:47,346
He's my son, and I'm coming.

609
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:59,525
I need you to promise me something.

610
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:02,528
I need you to promise me
that you will save him

611
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,905
no matter what and you
will get him back to me.

612
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:09,034
Yeah. Of course.

613
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:10,796
You realize this isn't
just about me, right?

614
00:31:10,797 --> 00:31:12,496
Like, h-he can't grow
up like Homelander.

615
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:14,373
You have to think of all of the people

616
00:31:14,415 --> 00:31:17,251
out there that he would...

617
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:22,965
Swear to me, then.

618
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:25,009
You swear to me on your brother's soul.

619
00:31:30,306 --> 00:31:32,474
I swear to you.

620
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:35,936
I swear to you on Lenny's soul.

621
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,900
- Okay. Okay.
- All right.

622
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:15,434
I can use your help loading the car.

623
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:25,402
What if it happens again?

624
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,863
When I see Stormfront...

625
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:29,531
Stormfront...

626
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:32,201
...what if I freeze?

627
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,705
"Freeze", yes?

628
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:38,374
Sorry, I'm still learning.

629
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:41,627
Look.

630
00:32:45,214 --> 00:32:47,758
If there's one thing I know,

631
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,762
it's that you can take care of yourself.

632
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:57,434
So when the time comes,
you'll know what to do.

633
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:03,440
Let's go.

634
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,948
Keep going. You got it.

635
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,908
That's it, don't give up.

636
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,244
That's it, that's it. Keep going.

637
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:19,081
Little more, little more, you got it.

638
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,586
Oh... hey, that's okay.

639
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:27,047
You'll get it, you'll get it. Um...

640
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:30,509
I know what.

641
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:33,137
Um, imagine, um...

642
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:37,057
Well, sometimes it helps to
imagine someone you hate. Okay?

643
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:39,518
So, try that.

644
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,270
But at home,

645
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:43,856
when I say "hate", I have to
put a quarter in the swear jar.

646
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:45,274
Well, there's no swear jar here.

647
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:48,986
So, you can hate away.

648
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,696
But I don't really hate anyone.

649
00:33:50,738 --> 00:33:52,239
Aw, well,

650
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:54,908
that is very sweet, Ryan.

651
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:58,120
But it's not something we can afford.

652
00:33:58,162 --> 00:33:59,955
We're under attack.

653
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:01,790
We are?

654
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:05,878
Bad guys want to hurt us just
'cause of what we look like.

655
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,880
They want to wipe us from this Earth,

656
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:10,924
just because of the color of our skin.

657
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,803
Really?

658
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:18,056
It's called white genocide.

659
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:22,394
And we're gonna need people
like you to protect our kind.

660
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:24,730
Hmm. All right.

661
00:34:24,772 --> 00:34:26,440
So, let's try again.

662
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:28,442
Go for it. Imagine, uh...

663
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:30,152
You got to be fucking kidding me!

664
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:33,989
What?

665
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:46,084
Are you sure this'll work?

666
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:47,503
Don't worry, it will work.

667
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:49,296
This is nothing compared to the raves

668
00:34:49,338 --> 00:34:51,048
I used to set up in Algiers.

669
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,674
Do you dance?

670
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,134
Of course I dance.

671
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:56,011
What is the point of
life without dancing?

672
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:01,141
She's on the move.

673
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:06,897
♪ One, two, three, four... ♪

674
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:08,732
I see her, Frenchie. We got to go now.

675
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:10,551
- You close?
- Un moment, mon ami.

676
00:35:10,592 --> 00:35:12,785
- Holy shit. It just broke.
- Stunning news coming out of Vought Tower

677
00:35:12,786 --> 00:35:14,905
in New York City, concerning Stormfront

678
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:18,033
and alleged Nazi ties.

679
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:19,827
Stormfront may be 100 years old.

680
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:23,956
What's even more incredible,
we have authenticated photos

681
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:26,750
showing Stormfront
with Nazi High Command,

682
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:29,211
including Goebbels and Göring.

683
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:33,048
Based on the photos, it is now
believed that she was the wife

684
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,425
of Frederick Vought, who
was of course the founder

685
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:36,927
of Vought International.

686
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:39,805
Already, an intense international outcry

687
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:41,557
has emerged, under...

688
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:43,518
I can't believe I
actually have to say this,

689
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:46,103
this day and age, but Nazis are bad.

690
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:50,065
♪ Nazi Stormfront, Hitler's star ♪

691
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:53,527
♪ Run her over with a car. ♪

692
00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:54,778
It's catchy.

693
00:35:58,198 --> 00:36:00,033
- You ready?
- Oui.

694
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:17,175
But the question now is how can
we possibly let Vought release

695
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:21,346
Compound V in light of this
unprecedented malfeasance?

696
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:23,268
- What's "malfeasance"?
- A Nazi in Seven Tower?

697
00:36:23,269 --> 00:36:25,309
- Uh, it's a...
- Was she part of the attack...

698
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,230
Never mind.

699
00:36:27,231 --> 00:36:28,770
Aah!

700
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:30,606
- What's happening?
- Don't know.

701
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:32,399
Stay here.

702
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,113
Now!

703
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:57,966
Ryan! Hey! Hey.

704
00:36:58,008 --> 00:37:00,969
Hey. Hey. Bud. Hey.

705
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:03,263
- Mom? Mom...
- It's me.

706
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:04,848
- Come here.
- Mom, Mom. I'm so sorry.

707
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,516
I didn't mean anything I said.

708
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:07,976
I'm sorry. I didn't mean any of it.

709
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:10,145
It's okay.

710
00:37:10,187 --> 00:37:11,980
- We got to go.
- I love you so much.

711
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:14,942
You're okay. We're gonna
go, okay? Come on.

712
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:16,401
Who's that?

713
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,072
That's my husband.

714
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,990
It's all right.

715
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:23,909
Come on.

716
00:37:23,951 --> 00:37:24,952
I got you.

717
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,789
Come on. To the car, this way.

718
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:49,017
What the fuck?

719
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,538
- Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
- What the hell

720
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:53,188
are they doing back here?

721
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:56,441
Butcher, this wasn't the plan.

722
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:58,068
What's going on?

723
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,444
What's wrong?

724
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:01,863
Take my car, get them both to Mallory.

725
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:03,281
Get them both safe.

726
00:38:03,283 --> 00:38:04,723
No, no. That's not part of the plan.

727
00:38:04,724 --> 00:38:05,993
The plan just changed.

728
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:07,714
M.M., you're the only
one I trust with 'em.

729
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:09,621
Hey. What's happening? No.

730
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:12,582
M.M.'s gonna take you
to a woman with the CIA.

731
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,418
What? No, you have to come with us.

732
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,878
I cut a deal with Stan Edgar.

733
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:21,800
What?

734
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:24,344
I cut a deal that when I got
Ryan, that I would call Vought.

735
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:26,179
They were gonna come and take him away,

736
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:28,932
and that you'd never
fucking see him again.

737
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:31,226
What?

738
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:35,689
But fuck me, I-I couldn't do it.

739
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,697
- Bedroom's clear.
- Kitchen's clear.

740
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:46,283
- All rooms secure.
- Mr. Butcher?

741
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,285
You here?

742
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:01,965
Did I hear you say "Butcher"?

743
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,676
What's going on?

744
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:06,438
Do you have the boy?

745
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,571
Where's my son?

746
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:31,369
Where is my son?!

747
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:34,831
I'm not... I'm not leaving here
without you. I don't care.

748
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,958
I was gonna sell you out.

749
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,627
I fucking well might do it again.

750
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:40,962
You didn't, though. You
didn't and you won't.

751
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:42,881
You can't have a cunt
like me around that kid.

752
00:39:42,923 --> 00:39:45,342
I don't want to pass my shit on to him.

753
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,279
Don't say that. You
have to come with us.

754
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,280
You raise him right.

755
00:39:48,281 --> 00:39:50,349
- You fucking raise him right.
- No. Don't say that.

756
00:39:50,352 --> 00:39:51,912
And I'll make sure they never find you.

757
00:39:51,913 --> 00:39:53,433
Don't you say that! Stop it. Stop.

758
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:56,228
- You have to come with us.
- Becca, we are out of time.

759
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:58,855
Please.

760
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,650
You got to let me do this.

761
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:04,194
You got to let me do
this one fucking thing.

762
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:08,216
Becca!

763
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:19,519
There you are, you
slippery little bitch!

764
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:22,689
I'm assuming it's you who sent
all those lies to the press.

765
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:23,982
They're not lies.

766
00:41:24,024 --> 00:41:26,443
The pictures are clearly deepfakes,

767
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,403
and you're a lying slut.

768
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:35,911
Okay.

769
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:38,955
Come here.

770
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:41,541
People love what I have to say.

771
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,627
They believe in it.

772
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:47,797
They just don't like the
word "Nazi", that's all.

773
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,008
Are you all right?

774
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:51,843
- You all right? Yeah?
- Ryan. Ryan, Ryan.

775
00:41:51,885 --> 00:41:55,513
- Ryan. Ryan!
- Ryan. Come here.

776
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:00,310
Are you okay? Are you okay?

777
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:02,312
Go. We'll hold her off.

778
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:03,855
You're okay.

779
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:09,402
What about the truth?

780
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:11,863
What truth?

781
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:14,199
What is the truth?

782
00:42:30,507 --> 00:42:32,467
And what are you laughing at?

783
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,310
She says the truth is,

784
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:45,647
she's gonna stick her
boot up your Nazi kitty.

785

Annie!

786
00:43:01,955 --> 00:43:03,581
Come on, the RPG!

787
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:05,750
It's in the car! It's our only chance!

Yeah!

Yeah.

Come here, Ryan.

805
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:36,401
Not on your life.

806
00:45:39,988 --> 00:45:42,907
You're not like her, Ryan.
You belong with us.

807
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:44,909
Stay the fuck away from my son!

808
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:46,202
We love you, Ryan.

809
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:53,376
You fucking bitch.

810
00:45:55,587 --> 00:45:56,587
Stop! Stop it!

811
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:58,840
Stop, please. Stop it!

812
00:45:58,882 --> 00:46:00,633
Stop, you're hurting
her. Just let her...

813
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:02,952
Stop it!

814
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:04,066
Stop, you're hurting her.

815
00:46:04,067 --> 00:46:05,638
Just let her go.

816
00:46:06,723 --> 00:46:09,017
Let her go!

817
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:12,061
- Stop!
- Look at me.

818
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:13,863
I like to see the light go out.

819
00:46:13,864 --> 00:46:15,190
Stop!

820
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:07,075
I'm sorry.

821
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:08,660
I'm sorry, Mom.

822
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:15,250
No. No...

823
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,294
No. No, no, no.

824
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:20,880
Hold on.

825
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:22,882
I'm sorry.

826
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:25,969
Help us!

827
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:29,347
Somebody help us!

828
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:36,646
It's not his fault. It's not his fault.

829
00:47:36,688 --> 00:47:38,356
You make sure he knows that.

830
00:47:38,398 --> 00:47:40,817
He, uh...

831
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:43,611
He's good. He's good.

832
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,616
He's good.

833
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:53,871
You promise me you'll keep him safe.

834
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:36,164
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

835
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:44,964
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

836
00:48:45,006 --> 00:48:46,049
Mommy.

837
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,842
Mom.

838
00:48:47,884 --> 00:48:50,094
Mom, please.

839
00:49:05,318 --> 00:49:06,944
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

840
00:49:41,813 --> 00:49:43,314
Ryan?

841
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:47,068
Did you do this?

842
00:49:48,111 --> 00:49:50,071
I didn't mean to.

843
00:49:53,783 --> 00:49:55,618
Let's go.

844
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:03,751
Come here.

845
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:09,716
Come.

846
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:16,264
Ryan... Ryan.

847
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:18,307
Come here.

848
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:29,026
No.

849
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,585
He's mine.

850
00:50:47,879 --> 00:50:51,424
What, are you gonna blow yourself up...

851
00:50:51,466 --> 00:50:54,677
to save the little shit who
fucking murdered your wife?

852
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:01,434
I promised.

853
00:51:03,186 --> 00:51:05,605
- Have it your way.
- Stop.

854
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:12,862
What are you doing here?

855
00:51:15,615 --> 00:51:17,825
You're gonna let them go.

856
00:51:20,036 --> 00:51:21,662
And if I don't?

857
00:51:23,915 --> 00:51:25,955
- Please!
- Don't die with them.

858
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:29,045
Let them go.

859
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:31,881
- Maeve!
- You're gonna stop hunting Starlight,

860
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:34,759
you're gonna leave me and Elena alone...

861
00:51:34,801 --> 00:51:36,177
Take my daughter!

862
00:51:36,219 --> 00:51:37,970
...or I release this.

863
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:41,599
If you do that...

864
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:46,229
...I'll destroy everything

865
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,439
- and everyone.
- Great.

866
00:51:48,481 --> 00:51:50,608
As long as everyone sees

867
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:53,277
what a fucking monster you are.

868
00:51:54,946 --> 00:51:56,489
As long as no one

869
00:51:56,531 --> 00:51:58,991
ever loves you again.

870
00:52:05,915 --> 00:52:09,043
Homelander! Homelander!

871
00:52:09,085 --> 00:52:10,461
Homelander!

872
00:52:10,503 --> 00:52:13,673
Homelander! Homelander...

873
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:56,674
We believe that Stormfront

874
00:52:56,716 --> 00:53:00,386
was the sole perpetrator of
the attack on Washington.

875
00:53:00,428 --> 00:53:03,806
In the light of Stormfront's atrocities,

876
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:08,519
the release of Compound V has
been placed on indefinite hold.

877
00:53:09,562 --> 00:53:10,980
Homelander?

878
00:53:11,022 --> 00:53:12,982
Mr. Edgar, we have a follow-up question.

879
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:20,489
Thanks to the heroism of
Queen Maeve and Starlight,

880
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:22,867
Stormfront has been neutralized,

881
00:53:22,909 --> 00:53:26,287
and is being held in an
undisclosed location.

882
00:53:26,329 --> 00:53:29,874
I would personally like
to apologize to Starlight,

883
00:53:29,916 --> 00:53:33,794
who was wrongfully accused
of sabotage and conspiracy.

884
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:36,005
Welcome back to the team.

885
00:53:36,047 --> 00:53:39,592
And I know that you and
Maeve are two of the best,

886
00:53:39,634 --> 00:53:42,970
most loyal friends
that I could ever have.

887
00:53:43,012 --> 00:53:45,806
We are your heroes.

888
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:48,643
We are here to serve and protect you.

889
00:53:48,684 --> 00:53:52,396
Stormfront's violation of
that special relationship,

890
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:56,275
of that trust, is unacceptable

891
00:53:56,317 --> 00:53:58,861
and she will be punished.

892
00:53:58,903 --> 00:54:01,280
Justice will be served.

893
00:54:11,332 --> 00:54:14,669
Justice will be served.
She will be punished.

894
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:18,923
As the leader of the Seven,
I give you my word,

895
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:21,550
no one will ever...

896
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:25,846
Gentlemen, thank you for coming.

897
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:28,307
Always happy to see you, sir.

898
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:29,517
I'm afraid we had

899
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:32,186
an incident at the Archives.

900
00:54:32,228 --> 00:54:35,398
Someone broke in and
stole PDR on Stormfront.

901
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:38,109
Hmm. PDR?

902
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:39,318
Private data reserve.

903
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,947
No one saw the thief come or go.

904
00:54:42,989 --> 00:54:46,367
Isn't that right, A-Train?

905
00:54:48,411 --> 00:54:49,954
That was you? Dude.

906
00:54:49,996 --> 00:54:52,081
I didn't know, sir. Fuck him.

907
00:54:52,123 --> 00:54:54,083
- I would never go behind your back.
- Please,

908
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:57,503
- just let me explain.
- I think it showed initiative.

909
00:54:57,545 --> 00:55:00,339
Stormfront's been critical of
the Church for a long time,

910
00:55:00,381 --> 00:55:03,718
and Vought needs to take a
firm anti-Nazi stance right now.

911
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:05,344
Wait.

912
00:55:05,386 --> 00:55:08,347
- D-Does that mean...
- I just spoke to Stan Edgar.

913
00:55:08,389 --> 00:55:09,849
You're back in.

914
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:11,851
- Fuck yeah!
- What? Yeah!

915
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:13,894
Yeah! A-Train is back, baby!

916
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:15,646
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

917
00:55:15,688 --> 00:55:17,440
- All right!
- Whew!

918
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:20,109
- Finally!
- Yeah.

919
00:55:20,151 --> 00:55:23,362
I'm back too, right?
Right? I'm anti-Nazi.

920
00:55:23,404 --> 00:55:27,199
I'm sorry, Deep, but
they only had one slot.

921
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:29,869
One hero is redemption, two is weakness.

922
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:31,287
So they took him?

923
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,289
Fuck yes, they did!

924
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:36,125
Well, shit! Peace out, bitch!

925
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:37,793
Ha ha!

926
00:55:39,837 --> 00:55:42,048
You have to be patient, Deep.

927
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:44,550
We'll get you into a few more
courses, up to Level Seven.

928
00:55:44,592 --> 00:55:46,672
No, I don't want to pay for
any more fucking courses!

929
00:55:46,673 --> 00:55:47,678
Deep, please calm down.

930
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,430
I signed over my bank account to you.

931
00:55:49,472 --> 00:55:51,974
I filled out all those fucking
children's workbooks!

932
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:55,227
I married some weirdo who
gives terrible blowjobs!

933
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:58,606
I-I did everything you asked,
and when I found out that

934
00:55:58,647 --> 00:56:00,900
we're all just fucking space
spores, I didn't laugh.

935
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:02,818
I did everything you asked.

936
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,862
Because you said you'd
get me back in the Seven.

937
00:56:04,904 --> 00:56:07,281
- You fucking promised.
- I'm sorry, Deep,

938
00:56:07,323 --> 00:56:09,742
but you are acting
like a toxic personality.

939
00:56:09,784 --> 00:56:11,410
I think you should leave.

940
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:18,751
Fuck Fresca.

941
00:56:26,217 --> 00:56:28,177
Look at you.

942
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:30,971
I know. I know...

943
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:34,892
But if Billy Butcher
can do the right thing,

944
00:56:34,934 --> 00:56:39,605
then there's got to be
some kind of higher power.

945
00:56:41,649 --> 00:56:43,484
You know?

946
00:56:43,526 --> 00:56:47,238
Are you sure it's safe for you
to go back into the Tower?

947
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:49,240
No.

948
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:52,326
No, I'm not. But...

949
00:56:52,368 --> 00:56:55,079
If you jump ship and you
let the assholes steer,

950
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:59,083
then you're part of the problem.

951
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:02,670
- And...
- Hmm.

952
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:06,465
...someone taught me something
about hanging in there.

953
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:22,398
I've been thinking about that lately...

954
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,942
the hanging in there.

955
00:57:24,984 --> 00:57:28,362
And I think maybe I am too clingy.

956
00:57:28,404 --> 00:57:30,447
- No, you're not.
- Sticking with people

957
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:33,325
just because I'm
terrified of losing them?

958
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:34,743
I-I...

959
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:38,205
I can't do that anymore.

960
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:42,168
I think it's time I go off,

961
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:44,420
stand on my own two feet for once.

962
00:57:48,257 --> 00:57:51,051
Right. Um...

963
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:57,808
Yeah, no worries. We'll, um...

964
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:01,645
We'll just be friends, then.

965
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:03,272
Oh... oh, God, no. No, no, no.

966
00:58:03,314 --> 00:58:05,434
I'm still gonna cling onto
you, I'm not fucking crazy.

967
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:30,090
So, if you weren't talking about me,

968
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:31,759
who were you talking about?

969
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:39,391
I'm scared.

970
00:58:55,783 --> 00:58:58,035
This here...

971
00:58:58,077 --> 00:59:00,204
belonged to your mum.

972
00:59:00,246 --> 00:59:03,082
This is St. Christopher.

973
00:59:03,123 --> 00:59:06,293
She gave it to me a long time ago,

974
00:59:06,335 --> 00:59:09,338
and told me...

975
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:10,923
it would keep me safe.

976
00:59:10,965 --> 00:59:13,384
And it has.

977
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:16,762
Mostly.

978
00:59:24,895 --> 00:59:28,482
Now your mum...

979
00:59:28,524 --> 00:59:30,234
is gonna help keep you safe.

980
00:59:38,534 --> 00:59:40,119
Come on.

981
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:49,545
Now...

982
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,922
remember what I told you.

983
00:59:52,965 --> 00:59:54,258
Don't be a cunt.

984
01:00:13,027 --> 01:00:15,529
William, I'm so sorry.

985
01:00:18,157 --> 01:00:20,117
Vought's gonna want him back.

986
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:22,328
Let me handle Vought.

987
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:25,247
You think he'll turn into his father?

988
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:32,880
Becca didn't think so.

989
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:36,800
I pray she's right.

990
01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:39,762
All the charges against you and
the Boys have been dropped.

991
01:00:39,803 --> 01:00:41,513
Even for the crimes you did commit.

992
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:43,265
You're a free man.

993
01:00:43,307 --> 01:00:47,186
And the White House is opening
an Office of Supe Affairs.

994
01:00:47,227 --> 01:00:49,730
Victoria Neuman is the new czar.

995
01:00:49,772 --> 01:00:52,483
She's sneaking me some
off-the-books funding

996
01:00:52,524 --> 01:00:54,860
for a team that can
keep tabs on the Supes.

997
01:00:56,195 --> 01:00:58,155

1020

Congratulations on the
appointment, Congresswoman.

1021
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:50,934
It's about time we had
an Office of Supe Affairs.

1022
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:53,216
Well, I know it was your intel
that took Stormfront down.

1023
01:02:53,217 --> 01:02:54,396
So, thank you.

1024
01:02:54,438 --> 01:02:56,565
Yeah, and that's just the start.

1025
01:02:56,607 --> 01:03:00,360
We have enough dirt
to ruin a dozen Supes.

1026
01:03:00,402 --> 01:03:02,905
Be a death blow for Stan Edgar.

1027
01:03:02,946 --> 01:03:04,656
That is, of course,

1028
01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:06,617
if you're open to, uh, expediting

1029
01:03:06,658 --> 01:03:09,203
the Church's tax-exempt status.

1030
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:11,663
Small price to pay.

1031
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:13,624
Call my office, set up a meeting?

1032
01:03:13,665 --> 01:03:16,210
You are one of the good ones, Vic.

1033
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:19,338
- See you soon.
- See you.

1034
01:04:00,337 --> 01:04:01,547
Hi.

1035
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:06,385
- Here's the research you asked for.
- Thank you.

1036
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:08,595
- And your 2:00 is waiting.
- Thank you.

1037
01:04:10,681 --> 01:04:11,890
Hugh Campbell.

1038
01:04:13,934 --> 01:04:17,187
I don't know how to repay
you for what you did.

1039
01:04:17,229 --> 01:04:19,815
- You know, I can think of a way.
- Oh?

1040
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:23,652
You can... give me a job.

1041
01:04:24,695 --> 01:04:25,988
You serious?

1042
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:28,240
Uh, what about your team?

1043
01:04:28,282 --> 01:04:31,159
Don't get me wrong, I-I-I still
want to fight Vought, I just...

1044
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:33,704
I want to do it the right way.

1045
01:04:33,745 --> 01:04:35,455
Not covered in quite as many guts.

1046
01:04:35,497 --> 01:04:38,417
Look, the truth is,

1047
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:41,044
I never totally fit in with the guys.

1048
01:04:41,086 --> 01:04:46,049
And... I think it's time I
stand on my own two feet.

1049
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:51,138
- They know you're here?
- I haven't told them yet.
