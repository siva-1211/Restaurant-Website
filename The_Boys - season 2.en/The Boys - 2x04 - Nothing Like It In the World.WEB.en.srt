2
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:16,900
Federal authorities have initiated

3
00:00:16,901 --> 00:00:19,145
a manhunt for William Butcher.

4
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,980
It's Vought. It's a fucking coup

5
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,481
from the inside.

6
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:23,983
I know who killed Raynor.

7
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:25,565
Something to do with the Supe terrorist

8
00:00:25,566 --> 00:00:26,609
smuggled into Jersey.

9
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:28,821
Her brother.

10
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:31,657
I just want me wife back.

11
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,939
Bring Langley the terrorist
and you'll have her.

12
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:37,621
I was told he would never
know about Ryan or me.

13
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,248
That was the deal.

14
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,791
You need to make him leave.

15
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,668
Because if you don't,
I'm gonna take Ryan

16
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,919
and I'm gonna run.

17
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,464
Superheroes are not born,

18
00:00:45,465 --> 00:00:47,673
but made, via Compound V.

19
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:49,508
We got a Supe terrorist below deck

20
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,553
and shit could go sideways just like...

21
00:00:58,476 --> 00:01:00,394
Ah, fucking diabolical!

22
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,068
I said he was mine.

23
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,710
You snooze, you lose, Gramps.

24
00:01:09,711 --> 00:01:11,030
Our newest hero,

25
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,115
Stormfront, stopped the terrorist

26
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:14,757
before he could take
more innocent lives.

27
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:19,455
Communication is everything.

28
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:21,165
Steve and I had been
dating for two years

29
00:01:21,207 --> 00:01:23,167
when he asked me to marry him.

30
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:24,752
At the rehearsal dinner, my dad said

31
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:27,588
we should look into a
529 account for our kids.

32
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,715
Steve laughed and said that was nuts

33
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:31,342
and that we were never having kids.

34
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:34,178
Which was, um, news to me.

35
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,806
Yeah. Long story short, um,

36
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,933
the caterer was totally
cool with everything,

37
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:42,061
but the Marriott did keep our
deposit on the banquet room.

38
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,021
So... Yeah.

39
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:45,481
Communication.

40
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:07,670
...details are still emerging
about the Supe terrorist

41
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,880
whose senseless attack
on an apartment building

42
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:14,176
left 59 people dead
and over 100 injured.

43
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:16,303
His name? Kenji Miyashiro,

44
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:18,722
a Japanese expatriate
living in the Philippines.

45
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:21,725
Miyashiro was radicalized
by the extremist group

46
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,769
Shining Light Liberation Army.

47
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,531
Witnesses who caught
a glimpse of the killer

48
00:02:25,532 --> 00:02:28,399
described him as
dead-eyed and unemotional

49
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,402
as he rampaged through
the apartment building

50
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:34,405
- killing indiscriminately.
- It wasn't your fault.

51
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:37,241
Many of the 59 victims have
not yet been identified...

52
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:40,160
Kimiko, look at me.

53
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:41,787
...to notify their families.

54
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,706
Look at me.

55
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,307
Investigators have so far not disclosed

56
00:02:45,308 --> 00:02:46,667
further details about the attack,

57
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,377
but officials have announced

58
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:51,422
they will hold a press
conference later this week.

59
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,758
I-I didn't mean to.

60
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,093
I'm sorry. I was just...

61
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:05,311
No one can debate

62
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,937
that New Yorkers owe their lives

63
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:09,148
to the brave actions
taken by Stormfront.

64
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,358
Earlier today, Stormfront
made an appearance

65
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,360
at a New York City park.

66
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,404
How many more people have to die?

67
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:18,115
You guys, I have been shouting

68
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:19,867
up and down the hallways at Vought,

69
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:22,069
and you know what they're
doing to stop another attack?

70
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,204
Jack [BLEEP].

71
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:25,956
Let's show Vought what they have to do.

72
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:28,208
Tomorrow morning, Vought Square.

73
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,587
Be your own hero. Make your voice heard.

74
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:34,965
I am counting on you to show us the way.

75
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,675
Don't let me down.

76
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:55,527
There you are.

77
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,622
I was beginning to worry.

78
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:14,797
I've missed you...

79
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:18,634
...so much.

80
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,471
Are you thirsty?

81
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:42,157
My good boy.

82
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,772
I ever tell you about
my recurring dream?

83
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:18,027
I'm on stage, alone, at Carnegie Hall.

84
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,863
The audience is made up
of every poor bastard

85
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,991
who got killed by the superheroes.

86
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:25,826
What are they doing?

87
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:31,206
Nothing. They're all just watching me.

88
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,459
Waiting for me to do something.

89
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,757
We hit a dead end on Raynor.

90
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,133
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,801
Christ, I don't want to hear sorry.

92
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,636
Sorry's not an option.

93
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,473
We can't have anonymous
skull-exploding assassins

94
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,099
walking around.

95
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:50,726
What if they hit the speaker next?

96
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:52,770
Or the president?

97
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:03,238
Liberty?

98
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,865
You mentioned her before.

99
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:07,117
Second-tier Supe, active in the '70s.

100
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,536
She was all over Susan's private server.

101
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,997
Get Marvin to talk to this Liberty.

102
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:15,125
Address on the back. North Carolina.

103
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,961
All right.

104
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,089
We'll see what we can find.

105
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,966
Wait.

106
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,808
I found Becca.

107
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,603
Or, at least, our best
guess where she is.

108
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:36,980
Vought facility, armed to the teeth.

109
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,607
Won't be easy.

110
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:42,069
We had a deal. I didn't come through.

111
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:44,154
Jesus, Butcher, I'm
just giving it to you.

112
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:51,537
It's my fault you stopped
searching for her.

113
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,789
I put a target on Homelander's back

114
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:56,416
and pointed you right at him.

115
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,336
I didn't know Becca was still...

116
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:04,299
It'd be good to have one less person

117
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,552
in that audience staring at me.

118
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:23,485
Hey!

119
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,029
See?

120
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:29,116
You get disrespected
over and over and over,

121
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:30,576
that's what happens.

122
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,412
I mean, how much shit
is he supposed to take?

123
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,039
Everybody respects you.

124
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,419
Fucking terrorist was my save, not hers.

125
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,045
It was mine.

126
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:47,843
What? Now that-that media
whore i-is the face of the Seven?

127
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:50,053
- No, she's not. No, you are.
- Come on.

128
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,514
And it's not just her,
it-it's the entire team.

129
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:53,932
- No.
- Yes, it is.

130
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:57,477
It-It's a whole chain of weak links.

131
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,191
I-It's very hard not
to take it personally.

132
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,067
Oh, I know.

133
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,778
I know.

134
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:12,034
I'll tell you one thing.

135
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:15,704
- You wouldn't put up with this shit.
- Mm-mm.

136
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:18,582
One little raise of the eyebrow,
and you would've knocked them

137
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:20,584
- all back in line.
- Yeah.

138
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:23,587
God, I miss that about you.

139
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:27,007
You don't need me to do that.

140
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:30,594
The Seven is your team.

141
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:33,931
You nurtured them, you
watered and fed them.

142
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,557
- That's... I did.
- Yes,

143
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,394
and if they can't respect that or you,

144
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:43,523
well, it may be time
to tear out the weeds

145
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:46,026
and start all over again.

146
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,539
Change back. Change back!

147
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,959
I'm sorry! I can only
hold a shape for so long

148
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,086
before it really hurts.

149
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:08,382
Change the fuck back now, Doppelganger!

150
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:16,098
Yeah, it's okay. Come here.

151
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,350
It's all good.

152
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,894
Oh, my little boy. Come on.

153
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:23,897
Okay.

154
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,941
It's okay.

155
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,322
I love you.

156
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:36,034
I love you.

157
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:40,038
You're the most powerful
man in the whole wide world.

158
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,293
And there's nothing that you cannot do.

159
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,135
Storming an off-the-books
Vought compound alone?

160
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:56,513
Butcher, how is it possible that
you're dumber than you look?

161
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:59,474
- Mate, it's Becca.
- No shit.

162
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,685
But win or lose, you ain't coming back.

163
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:02,894
Course I am.

164
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,064
That's bullshit.

165
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,066
Look, it's not like Vought's

166
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,027
gonna let us settle down in Orlando.

167
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,820
We got to get gone and stay gone.

168
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:13,822
What about us? Hmm?

169
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,866
We're the Spice Girls, right?

170
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:20,954
You're in charge now.

171
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,456
Mazel tov.

172
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:25,292
Motherfucker, I don't
want to be in charge.

173
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:27,794
Matter of fact, I don't
even want to be here.

174
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,463
I gave up my family for this.

175
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,089
For you.

176
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,507
When do I get them back?

177
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,052
You find this Liberty slag.

178
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,429
See what you can rumble.

179
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,514
You jump through a few
hoops for the colonel,

180
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,683
and she'll help you the
same way she helped me.

181
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:44,353
She always liked you more, anyway.

182
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,607
And what about Frenchie?

183
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,485
He's been high as kite for days.

184
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,529
- He won't even notice I'm gone.
- Hmm.

185
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,989
And Hughie?

186
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:01,203
Kid's a weeper.

187
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,663
Don't want him to get
snot all over me jacket.

188
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,544
Hey, Homelander.

189
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:14,317
Maeve begged me

190
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,737
to spare your life.

191
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,907
So I gave you a second chance,

192
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:25,120
and... you failed me.

193
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,790
What are you talking about?

194
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,962
No more lies.

195
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,427
You go ahead and scream.

196
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:43,472
As much as you want.

197
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,059
What... what did I do?

198
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,728
I told you to kill Hugh Campbell,

199
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,146
and you hesitated.

200
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:53,857
I-I said that we should
go to the police.

201
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:58,236
You disobeyed my orders
because you're with him.

202
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,074
Fuck you.

203
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:07,662
Hughie Campbell broke my fucking heart.

204
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:11,082
Worse than anyone ever has.

205
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,503
And part of me wants to
blast his fucking face off,

206
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:18,715
so no, I'm not "with him".

207
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:23,553
But if you want to kill me
because I'm not a murderer

208
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:26,515
and I won't straight-up execute someone,

209
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,558
then go ahead.

210
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,853
So, tell me,

211
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:35,106
am I lying?

212
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:43,365
You're not lying.

213
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,007
Ooh.

214
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:04,719
Black Noir. Hi.

215
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,888
Would you like an Almond Joy?

216
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:28,326
Um, do you mean William Butcher?

217
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,415
Okay.

218
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:40,589
Well, he was definitely on
the yacht with the terrorist.

219
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,216
Some of his known accomplices were, too.

220
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:46,136
We lost him in these storm tunnels.

221
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,471
So, yeah.

222
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,765
There you go.

223
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,726
I'll keep you posted when we find them.

224
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:59,065
Or I can look right now.

225
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:02,402
Just, uh, run a facial
recognition search.

226
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,158
Or you can join me.

227
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:18,376
Hey.

228
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,962
- Thanks for coming.
- Hey.

229
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:25,050
- Oh, you're so bruised.
- Oh, no, it's fine. It's okay.

230
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,301
That was all me?

231
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:28,511
It's cool. Really.

232
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,972
I mean, you know, chicks dig bruises.

233
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:32,894
You know, I was in...
When I was in fifth grade,

234
00:15:32,895 --> 00:15:34,309
I took a tetherball to the face.

235
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:35,894
And Amy Burtenshaw, she brought me

236
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,104
Jell-O Pudding Pops
for, like, two weeks.

237
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,648
I'm talking way too much.

238
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,109
I could've killed you.

239
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,113
But you didn't.

240
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,325
Um...

241
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:54,996
I got your voice mail.

242
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:57,832
Oh, God. Can... Oh, God.

243
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:00,293
Can we just chalk that
up to a-a drunk dial?

244
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:03,421
I-I'm okay, really, it's just, uh...

245
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,006
Do you just mind, you mind

246
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,925
- if we just don't talk about it?
- Okay.

247
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,344
So, we got the Compound V out there,

248
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:10,720
and Vought is still kicking,

249
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,515
so we risked our lives

250
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:17,435
just to make the world way worse.

251
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,271
Yeah, but no, no, no. That's not true.

252
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:23,149
I mean, you know, these things, they...

253
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,568
Look, Annie, they take time.

254
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,987
How much time?

255
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,617
Just...

256
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,413
Sorry, just give me one second.

257
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:39,457
Um... Hey, M.M.

258
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:44,963
Raleigh? Like, the one
in North Carolina?

259
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,341
Yeah, okay, okay.
Jesus, I was just asking.

260
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:52,011
Um, yeah. Yeah.

261
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,139
Um, just pick me up

262
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,183
at, like, 81st and-and
Central Park West.

263
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,687
Okay, okay, all right.

264
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:03,898
Um, I have to go.

265
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,191
What's going on?

266
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,861
Can I call you later?

267
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,914
Are you just gonna...

268
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,666
hang out?

269
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,376
Here?

270
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,044
Yeah, I...

271
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:28,047
I just... I can't go back
to the Tower right now.

272
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,341
Why? What happened?

273
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,844
I can't...

274
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:35,472
I can't do this anymore.

275
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:46,566
Are you fucking insane?

276
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:49,110
She can't come with us,
Hughie. She's chipped.

277
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:51,821
So, I have a second cousin
who lives around there.

278
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:54,741
I could tell Vought
that I'm going to visit.

279
00:17:54,755 --> 00:17:57,075
And we'd be out of the city,
away from the cameras.

280
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,244
I mean, no one would see us.

281
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:02,540
No. Even her standing here is dangerous.

282
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,626
Maybe he's right. I...

283
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,461
This is a bad idea.

284
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,550
If we're gonna go knock
on some Supe's door,

285
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,594
don't you think it makes
a little bit of sense

286
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:18,056
for us to have one of our own?

287
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,808
Look, she's in rough shape.

288
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:22,310
She needs this.

289
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,148
You mean you need this?

290
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,201
Hey. How you doing? Cool.

291
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:39,994
What's up, man?

292
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:52,465
Oh, fuck!

293
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:54,467
Don't bullshit me,

294
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:56,300
- Ashley.
- Shockwave is just here

295
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,929
to talk about Vought for Tots.

296
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,180
I swear to God.

297
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:01,349
What the fuck is Vought for Tots?

298
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:03,476
It's a new fitness
outreach for toddlers.

299
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:05,144
Apparently, they're getting obese.

300
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:08,189
Well, shit, I fucking
love fat kids. Use me.

301
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:10,608
Oh, good, you're here.

302
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,235
You tell him yet?

303
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:14,737
Tell me what?

304
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:17,282
I thought we were gonna
have a strategy meeting.

305
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,449
A-Train, you're out.

306
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,701
Out of what?

307
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,494
Out of the Seven.

308
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:24,289
You did great, but we're going
in a different direction, so...

309
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,374
you're out.

310
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,126
What the fuck?

311
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,878
You just said everything was fine.

312
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,422
You're gonna have a
whole year of parades.

313
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:34,007
Tribute concerts.

314
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,842
You're gonna hit the talk show circuit.

315
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:37,802
You're-you're gonna have
your own reality show

316
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,137
on Vought+.

317
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,014
The outpouring of love and gratitude

318
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,181
is gonna be off the charts.

319
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,767
Oh, this is bullshit!

320
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,854
You used to get my fucking coffee!

321
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:53,067
Oh, fuck this. I'm not going.

322
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,862
A-Train... you can't run.

323
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,989
Yes, I can run.

324
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,949
- I just... I-I just...
- Buddy?

325
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:03,036
You think I don't know
what's been going on?

326
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:06,664
It's your heart.

327
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,250
I doubt you're even
cracking the top 20 anymore,

328
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:12,295
and that makes the Seven...
me... look pretty ridiculous.

329
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,048
I do want you to know, though,

330
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,341
this was really hard for me.

331
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:17,550
Okay?

332
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:18,927
It's nothing personal.

333
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,304
Uh, we'll always be friends and, uh...

334

Et cetera.

335
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,767
Attaboy.

336
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:45,954
Does anyone mind if I put on some music?

337
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:46,996

This ain't no little
Vegas road trip, okay?

362
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,724
Y'all ain't on no date, either.

363
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,184
Just... chill.

364
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:53,980
I'm not your goddamn chaperone.

365
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,236
They say if you love someone,

366
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:03,906
you should set them free.
But that seems crazy to me,

367
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:07,452
because if you love someone,
you will never let them go.

368
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:08,870
Never.

369
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,914
Have you heard of the Lovers of Valdaro?

370
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:14,167
They were alive, like, 6,000 years ago,

371
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,461
and they were found
in this tomb in Italy.

372
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:20,923
These two skeletons with
their arms around each other.

373
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:25,053
That's love.

374
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,455
Open up the door.

375
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,126
Bonjour.

376
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:59,462
You smell like a wet dog.

377
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:01,923
Oh, you want a drink?

378
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,466
Mm-mm.

379
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:05,760
Whoa. Who says I'm alone, asshole?

380
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:23,486
So... are you gonna
tell me what's wrong?

381
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:26,531
Or you just gonna stain my clean sheets

382
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,407
with your sweaty despair?

383
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:32,537
I tried to kiss her.

384
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,497
Kimiko?

385
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:36,582
Her brother died.

386
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:39,502
I wanted to make her feel better.

387
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:41,420
You thought a kiss would
make her feel better

388
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:42,630
or you feel better?

389
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:45,258
She was in pain. I wanted to help.

390
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,426
You always want to help.

391
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:48,636
So?

392
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:51,347
You think

393
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:53,724
that by saving her,

394
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,143
you can make amends

395
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,770
for all the people you hurt.

396
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:04,402
For those children
that Lamplighter burned.

397
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,613
- Okay.
- You don't know anything.

398
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:13,703
Look, she's not a kitten up a tree.

399
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:19,333
Just leave her alone. Hmm?

400
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,836
Let her grieve.

401
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:25,882
What good does grieving
all alone ever do?

402
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:29,093
And in our continuing coverage

403
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,679
of the recent revelations
over Compound V,

404
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:33,121
protesters all over the Middle East

405
00:24:33,123 --> 00:24:34,643
have taken to the streets demanding...

406
00:24:34,644 --> 00:24:36,142
- Thank you.
- I'll be right back.

407
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:45,026
Meanwhile, at the United Nations,

408
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,387
governments from all over the
world have voiced their anger

409
00:24:47,388 --> 00:24:49,322
at the Compound V revelation.

410
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:51,199
- Mm.
- Today, Russia and China

411
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,118
referred to the superheroes as
weapons of mass destruction

412
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,476
and accused the United States

413
00:24:55,477 --> 00:24:56,871
- of terrorism...
- Mm.

414
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:58,998
You two want a room?

415
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:03,419
You and the doughnut.

416
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:05,087
Oh.

417
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:06,380
I'm sorry.

418
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,965
It's just, um,

419
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:11,677
my mom never let me have this stuff.

420
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,776
- Hmm.
- It's just... weight gain

421
00:25:13,777 --> 00:25:14,805
in our household

422
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,724
was a capital crime.

423
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:19,477
But my dad, um,

424
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,187
he'd take me to Dunkin' on the sly.

425
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:25,775
And he would get me a
chocolate cream-filled doughnut,

426
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:29,237
and he'd ask me to
tell him about my day.

427
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:37,411
And he'd... he'd listen.

428
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:41,832
Baskin-Robbins.

429
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,628
Every Sunday after church.

430
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:50,049
My pops, he'd always ask

431
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:51,592
for samples.

432
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:54,845
Now, this place had 31 flavors,

433
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:58,182
and that man would taste
each and every flavor

434
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:00,351
every time we'd go up in there.

435
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:02,073
There'd be a line all
the way out the door.

436
00:26:02,074 --> 00:26:03,938
People would be mad as hell. Yelling.

437
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,606
Cussing. "Yo, my man,

438
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:07,942
get your fucking ice cream and bounce!"

439
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:09,610
You think that stopped him?

440
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:11,529
Hell, nah. He would stand right there

441
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,155
and order another sample.

442
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:16,450
"Can I please try the Jamoca
Almond Fudge, please?"

443
00:26:18,286 --> 00:26:20,454
My ass was so embarrassed.

444
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,164
I'd be sitting there, wishing the floor

445
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,834
would just open up and
just swallow me whole.

446
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:27,503
Man.

447
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:31,007
Course, now I'd give a year
off my life just to be able

448
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:33,134
to see that man going
through spoon after spoon

449
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:35,886
just one last time.

450
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,433
When did he...

451
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:41,976
16 years ago.

452
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:49,483
To fathers and sugar.

453
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,778
To fathers and sugar.

454
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,247
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. Are you dry wiping?

455
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:06,125
Am I what?

456
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:07,793
Come here.

457
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:09,670
Listen, any part of your body,

458
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:11,255
- and I mean any part...
- Mm-hmm.

459
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:14,592
When you dry wipe, you're
not cleaning anything.

460
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,393
You're just smearing
shit all over your skin.

461
00:27:16,394 --> 00:27:20,139
Here. Got to use wet
wipes. There you go.

462
00:27:20,181 --> 00:27:22,767
- You just carry these around with you?
- Damn right...

463
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,176
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, please!

464
00:27:32,218 --> 00:27:33,286
They're hurt!

465
00:27:33,327 --> 00:27:35,044
- They need help!
- No, please. No, no, no.

466
00:27:35,045 --> 00:27:36,405
This is not the time to be a Supe.

467
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:37,948
Okay? We're low-key, not with us here.

468
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,116
- Annie?
- I...

469
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:40,534
There's a ton of people here.

470
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,620
Okay, that guy, he's calling 911.

471
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,081
It'll be okay.

472
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:47,792
Come on. Come on, we gotta go.

473
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,393
- This was a bad idea.
- Just calm down.

474
00:27:49,394 --> 00:27:50,953
- This was a stupid idea.
- Calm down.

475
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:18,531
Any place around here without
a million bloody cameras?

476
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,368
Are you okay?

477
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,828
- Did he hurt you?
- No.

478
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,038
I'm okay, I'm fine.

479
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,709
I thought you were dead.

480
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,502
I stopped looking. I
shouldn't have stopped.

481
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:15,629
I couldn't call anybody. I can't imagine

482
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,298
what it must've done to you. I'm sorry.

483
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,633
I'm so fucking sorry.

484
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,719
No, you've done nothing wrong.

485
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,685
Look at you.

486
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:33,105
My girl.

487
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:35,816
Always.

488
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:44,033
Billy, it's not safe for you to be here.

489
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:47,203
If he finds you, he's gonna kill you

490
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:48,913
and you know that.

491
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,915
Fuck him.

492
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,917
I got out of the last
scrape all right, didn't I?

493
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,668
That was a one-time deal.

494
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,670
What did you say to him?

495
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:59,632
I said if he hurt you...

496
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:02,593
I would kill myself in front of Ryan.

497
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:04,637
And my last words would be,

498
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:06,805
"Your father did this to me".

499
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:11,060
He seems desperate for a
relationship with his son,

500
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:12,770
so it worked once.

501
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,439
Well, it's a good thing

502
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:17,483
he don't know your tells.

503
00:30:17,525 --> 00:30:19,443
I wasn't bluffing.

504
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,197
I'm gonna get you the fuck out of here.

505
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:24,823
Yeah, how?

506
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:28,369
Over the fence, the
same way that I came in.

507
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,954
No, no.

508
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:32,122
Ryan-Ryan can't climb that fence.

509
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,793
Right.

510
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:43,384
I saw his-his eyes glow.

511
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:44,468
I thought he might...

512
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,761
Don't he got no powers?

513
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:47,763
N-No, I-I mean...

514
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:50,516
Yes, but I'm not... I'm
not raising him like that.

515
00:30:56,105 --> 00:30:57,314
Hey.

516
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,024
There's a garbage truck.

517
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:01,777
It comes by the house
every morning at 11:00.

518
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:04,488
I doubt anyone checks the hopper.

519
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,010
You sure it's not a fucking compacter?

520
00:31:06,011 --> 00:31:07,262
Yes, I'm sure.

521
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:10,076
Okay.

522
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:11,370
Then that's the plan.

523
00:31:11,412 --> 00:31:13,664
Yeah, yeah.

524
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:21,922
I have to go.

525
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:24,633
They get suspicious
when I'm gone too long.

526
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:30,097
Wait here, I'll be back.

527
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:32,141
Okay?

528
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,029
Okay, so, we got two rooms.

529
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,073
There's three of us,
so I guess I'll be, uh...

530
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:52,620
...bunking with M.M., naturally.

531
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:53,954
Good choice.

532
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:26,278
Mmm.

533
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,988
- Is that an Almond Joy?
- Mm-hmm.

534
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:31,241
Nobody likes Almond Joy.

535
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:33,243
Jeffrey Dahmer...

536
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,454
That's it, he's the only one.

537
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:38,457
This in my top three for sure.

538
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:39,875
What are your other two?

539
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:41,669
Mm...

540
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,921
Charleston Chew...

541
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,297
and Bit-O-Honey.

542
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:47,091
Jesus Christ!

543
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,301
Those are the, like,
three worst candy bars

544
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:50,863
in the history of candy!

545
00:32:50,864 --> 00:32:52,554
That's it, you're-you're sick.

546
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:54,181
In the brain.

547
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:01,647
Hey, what's up with M.M.'s OCD?

548
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:03,065
Wait, what-what OCD?

549
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:06,527
You know, when he changes lanes,

550
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:09,780
he taps the steering wheel three times.

551
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:13,659
He stirs the coffee three times.

552
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:15,452
The antiseptic wipes... Really?

553
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,162
You haven't noticed any of this?

554
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:18,872
No, but wow, you're right.

555
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,249
Mm-hmm.

556
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,584
Yeah.

557
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:26,130
It's just control over things
he can't control, I guess.

558
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,632
I mean...

559
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:31,885
I should be the last
one talking about that.

560
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:35,973
Says the girl who's just
stress-eating all day.

561
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,307
Oh, my God!

562
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,949
That was... I...

563
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,436
Was so good, that was really good.

564
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:42,479
I enjoyed that.

565
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,358
It's harder than it looked.

566
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,193
Nah.

567
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:49,915
I think, you know,
actually, I think I went

568
00:33:49,916 --> 00:33:51,572
the other way with the eating.

569
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:54,408
I think I lost, like, seven pounds.

570
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:55,826
Mm.

571
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:57,578
I did not have seven to lose.

572
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:00,205
Well... oh, I sleep

573
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:02,916
about four hours a night.

574
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,085
I wish I slept four hours a night.

575
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:06,879
I mean, I'm too busy

576
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,174
chewing my fingernails
down to the quick.

577
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,593
I don't know, whatever a...

578
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:15,220
I don't know what a quick is, but...

579
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:17,514
Here's one.

580
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:23,604
I walk around the Seven Tower

581
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:25,647
with this...

582
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:28,609
knot in my gut.

583
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,152
Just wondering

584
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:32,821
if Homelander is waiting

585
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:36,658
around every corner to kill me.

586
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:41,288
It's like living with a
loaded gun in my face.

587
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:44,374
Do you feel that way now?

588
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:11,083
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

589
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,486
I got it.

590
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,119
But I still want to see you.

591
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:26,291
Love is a leap of faith.

592
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:30,212
Like, my last boyfriend was
obsessed with Ed Sheeran.

593
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:32,005
Yeah, I know.

594
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:34,049
But he was obsessed.

595
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:37,469
"Shape of You", "Galway
Girl", whole catalog.

596
00:35:37,511 --> 00:35:39,596
So, he asked me

597
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,640
to get one of these with him.

598
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:47,437
Two weeks later, he broke up with me.

599
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:50,649
I fucking hate Ed Sheeran.

600
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:02,554
Took you ages to quit.

601
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:05,390
All them little patches, eh?

602
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:09,436
Do you want one?

603
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:11,438
No.

604
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,576
The beard's new.

605
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:27,996
Fancy it, eh?

606
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:30,415
Eh, haven't decided yet.

607
00:37:34,962 --> 00:37:36,964
How long you been here for then, eh?

608
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,802
Since I gave birth.

609
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:45,806
Fucking hell.

610
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,268
How you holding up?

611
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,483
Yeah, you know, you forget about

612
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:59,236
reading the news or...

613
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:02,322
going to a restaurant...

614
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:05,742
smoking pot on the couch
and eating Cheetos.

615
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,955
I just act like, you know,

616
00:38:09,997 --> 00:38:11,999
Carol fucking Brady all day.

617
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:16,545
It's okay.

618
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:20,090
You know, Ryan's happy, and...

619
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:21,591
that's what matters.

620
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:28,974
You're gonna like him.

621
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:33,520
He's sweet...

622
00:38:33,562 --> 00:38:36,064
and very smart and...

623
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:38,525
so kind.

624
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:43,613
I know you hate kids and all,
but I think that he's pretty...

625
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:46,408
Oh, no, no, no, I don't,
I don't hate kids.

626
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:49,703
Just...

627
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:52,497
I'm not a very good role model, am I?

628
00:38:56,043 --> 00:38:58,128
How have you been?

629
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:02,215
Oh, you know, all right.

630
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:07,054
Started a private security company.

631
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:10,974
You know, weddings, bar mitzvahs...

632
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:13,435
Bullshit.

633
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:18,273
Homelander said you were

634
00:39:18,315 --> 00:39:20,776
"a man possessed".

635
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:23,945
He said you've been
chasing after him for years.

636
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:28,408
Well, I thought he killed you.

637
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,660
So... yeah.

638
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,954
I've been on a bit of a warpath.

639
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,458
But on the bright side,

640
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,001
I'm sleeping in a basement

641
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:40,754
beneath a pawn shop in East Flatbush.

642
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,883
I'm sorry.

643
00:39:44,925 --> 00:39:47,719
I never wanted that for you.

644
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:50,972
What was I supposed to do?

645
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:52,516
Hmm?

646
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:55,185
Let him get away with it?

647
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:57,771
What was I before you?

648
00:39:57,813 --> 00:40:00,315
Nothing.

649
00:40:00,357 --> 00:40:03,860
And you saved me.

650
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,946
And here you've been,

651
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:08,156
fucking living in this shithole

652
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:10,075
for all this time,

653
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:12,619
and I haven't been here for you.

654
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,791
I'm gonna make it up to you.

655
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:20,794
I'm gonna make it up to you
from now till the day I die,

656
00:40:20,836 --> 00:40:22,754
I swear to God.

657
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,743
Is the supervillain threat real?

658
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:54,911
Hundred percent.

659
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,830
Very real.

660
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:58,290
But the Seven will protect you.

661
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:00,876
That's right, right.
Always listen to Maeve.

662
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:03,044
She always tells the truth.

663
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:05,630
And we're grateful every day.

664
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:08,425
On a related subject, Compound V.

665
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,261
Did either of you know about
it before the news broke?

666
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:13,388
No. Absolutely not.

667
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:15,974
Madelyn Stillwell,
she lied to all of us.

668
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:17,809
Turns out she was a monster.

669
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:20,979
We're-we're just as hurt
and upset and confused

670
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:22,814
as everyone else.

671
00:41:22,856 --> 00:41:25,317
Let's talk #HeroesSoWhite.

672
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:27,861
The numbers are rather startling.

673
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:29,988
92% of heroes are Caucasian.

674
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:32,991
African American, six percent.

675
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:35,952
Latin and Asian, each one percent.

676
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:38,622
Why doesn't Vought want diversity?

677
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:42,626
Wow. These are real
hardballs, Maria Menounos.

678
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,712
But check your facts.

679
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:48,673
Let's, uh, take the Seven, for example.

680
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:50,467
We've got A-Train. He's a black man.

681
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:54,262
We got Black Noir. He, um...

682
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:56,848
Well, he doesn't identify
with any race, really,

683
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:59,434
so... they're covered.

684
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:02,938
And... we have a gay hero.

685
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,232
Really?

686
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:07,359
Who in the Seven is gay?

687
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,986
Queen Maeve.

688
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:12,989
Mm-hmm. Scoop for you, Maria.

689
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:16,117
Maeve here is a strong, proud lesbian

690
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:19,371
with a beautiful girlfriend, Elena.

691
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:20,830
Hispanic girlfriend.

692
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:25,085
And I, for one, am so proud of her.

693
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:27,128
Where's Elena?

694
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,714
What did you do to her?

695
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:31,383
She's fine.

696
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:34,177
What did I do to her? I set her free.

697
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,554
And you. You've been living
in the shadows so long,

698
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:38,765
doesn't it feel good
to be out in the sun?

699
00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:40,600
Hold on.

700
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:43,395
Me and Elena are just friends.

701
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:45,772
- Oh. Just friends?
- Yes.

702
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:47,814
Because, see, I heard you
two talking on the phone,

703
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,943
and it sounded a
little more than friends.

704
00:42:49,985 --> 00:42:52,904
So, I did a little digging,

705
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:55,615
and imagine my fucking surprise.

706
00:42:55,657 --> 00:42:57,951
Okay.

707
00:42:57,993 --> 00:43:00,954
- We had a relationship once.
- Hmm.

708
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:03,373
Once. A relationship... "Relationship".

709
00:43:03,415 --> 00:43:06,793
That's such a vague word.
What does that mean to you?

710
00:43:06,835 --> 00:43:08,795
What, long walks in the park?

711
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:10,839
A shoulder to cry on?

712
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,174
Scissoring each other raw?

713
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:17,637
I ended the relationship
when I joined the Seven.

714
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:20,807
When I met you.

715
00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:23,184
Stop fucking lying to me.

716
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:29,274
I am at my wit's fucking
end with the lies.

717
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:33,236
We're together.

718
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:35,488
And you love her?

719
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:41,036
Hmm.

720
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:43,455
I see.

721
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:46,333
Well, best of luck to you both.

722
00:43:48,585 --> 00:43:52,255
Oh, is it so hard to believe that
I want you two to be happy?

723
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:54,507
And in love?

724
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:57,093
Honestly, Maeve, I am

725
00:43:57,135 --> 00:44:01,765
really, really happy for you.

726
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:17,822
And have you seen Vought's
"Saving America" ads?

727
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:22,202
Don't they make you feel all
warm and squishy and patriotic?

728
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:28,792
Vought wants you to feel calm and safe

729
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:31,669
so that you continue to
buy their shitty toys

730
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:34,089
and drinking their shitty energy drinks

731
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:36,591
and going to see their shitty movies.

732
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:39,969
But maybe we shouldn't feel so calm.

733
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:42,138
Or safe.

734
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:46,184
One Super terrorist has
already gotten through.

735
00:44:46,226 --> 00:44:47,852
More will come.

736
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:49,521
And for all we know,

737
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:52,357
these maniacs could already
have flown over our borders

738
00:44:52,399 --> 00:44:54,401
and be standing next to you,

739
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:56,903
just waiting for their
chance to kill us all.

740
00:44:56,945 --> 00:44:58,488
So what are we gonna do?

741
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:00,323
We're gonna sit around
and cross our fingers

742
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:03,785
that Homelander's gonna save us
when he's not on Maria Menounos?

743
00:45:03,827 --> 00:45:05,286
No!

744
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:07,205
Or will we demand

745
00:45:07,247 --> 00:45:09,249
that Vought do better?

746
00:45:11,126 --> 00:45:14,003
That our government do better!

747
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:15,672
What do you say?

748
00:45:24,431 --> 00:45:26,391
No.

749
00:45:26,433 --> 00:45:29,519
Mon coeur, please. You will not survive.

750
00:45:29,561 --> 00:45:31,161
Stormfront! Stormfront!

751
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:33,481
Stormfront! Stormfront!

752
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:37,944
Marry me, Stormfront!

753
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:42,782
Let's go home.

754
00:46:04,888 --> 00:46:06,764
- Hello?
- Uh,

755
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:09,267
hello, um...

756
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:11,561
I'm Hughie. Is-is there, by any chance,

757
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:13,646
a woman living here who
used to go by the name

758
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:15,690
of, um, Liberty?

759
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:20,111
No.

760
00:46:20,153 --> 00:46:22,614
Okay, we have the right address, right?

761
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:24,240
Is that...?

762
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:36,836
- Please leave.
- Miss,

763
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:39,214
I'm sorry if my friend offended you.

764
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:41,257
But we just want to ask
just a couple of questions.

765
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:43,301
Just leave me alone.

766
00:46:43,343 --> 00:46:46,137
I took your damn money,
I signed your damn papers,

767
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:47,388
and I have kept my mouth shut.

768
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,349
You think we're w...
We're not with Vought.

769
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:51,100
Okay? We...

770
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:53,228
We just want to learn
what we can about Liberty.

771
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:54,521
That's it.

772
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:57,190
Then y'all are just some damn fools.

773
00:46:57,232 --> 00:46:58,816
It sounds like you know her.

774
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:00,777
Or knew her.

775
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,946
You're wasting your time.

776
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:05,657
- Okay?
- Miss, Miss, Miss. Hear us out.

777
00:47:05,698 --> 00:47:08,826
If, after that, you want
us to leave, we'll go.

778
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:12,163
Go ahead.

779
00:47:13,957 --> 00:47:17,377
My father was a lawyer.

780
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:20,630
Small-time, very smart. And aggressive.

781
00:47:20,672 --> 00:47:22,792
When I was a kid, something
happened between my family

782
00:47:22,793 --> 00:47:25,802
and Vought, which I'd rather
not talk about, but it was bad.

783
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,846
Now, see, my dad, he believed in the law

784
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:33,059
and that nobody was
above it, not even Vought.

785
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:36,312
So he went to work. He
got after their asses.

786
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:38,398
He had one of those...

787
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:40,191
Remember those little black typewriters,

788
00:47:40,233 --> 00:47:41,568
manual ones with the keys?

789
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:43,444
I'd go to sleep at
night to all that noise,

790
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:45,154
my father banging away at that thing.

791
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:48,616
Wake up the next morning,
he'd still be hammering away.

792
00:47:48,658 --> 00:47:50,368
All night.

793
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:53,037
But see, Vought wasn't about
to let this one black man

794
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:54,664
put his foot on their necks.

795
00:47:54,706 --> 00:47:56,291
Mm-mm.

796
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:59,043
So they hired teams of lawyers.

797
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:00,920
Paid off judges.

798
00:48:00,962 --> 00:48:03,298
But my father never gave up.

799
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:06,718
Till one morning I woke up and...

800
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:10,888
I didn't hear those keys anymore.

801
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:14,225
Just found him hunched over
that typewriter, dead at 55.

802
00:48:14,267 --> 00:48:16,227
I'm so sorry for your loss.

803
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:18,730
I'm not here for your sympathy.

804
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:23,318
But I am gonna tell you that his
fight got passed down to me.

805
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:27,030
And I'm gonna make Vought
pay for what they did to him

806
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:28,406
and, ma'am, from what I gather,

807
00:48:28,448 --> 00:48:30,700
what they've done to you, as well.

808
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:35,288
I mean... it's been 48 years.

809
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:37,915
What good is dredging all
this stuff up now gonna do?

810
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:40,209
Honestly we don't know.

811
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:41,878
But we still need to hear it.

812
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:49,802
I tried to get people to listen.

813
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:53,723
Lord knows, so many times, I tried.

814
00:48:53,765 --> 00:48:56,601
But a little black girl accusing

815
00:48:56,643 --> 00:49:00,563
a white superhero of
murder in these parts?

816
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:01,773
Yeah.

817
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:07,487
It was during one of those summer rains

818
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:09,447
that you just knew was coming

819
00:49:09,489 --> 00:49:11,449
by the smell in the air.

820
00:49:15,745 --> 00:49:18,790
I was 11 years old,

821
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:22,043
asleep in the back
seat of my folks' Ford.

822
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:25,380
My brother Myron, he was driving.

823
00:49:28,157 --> 00:49:29,650
What's the trouble, ma'am?

824
00:49:29,692 --> 00:49:30,751
Get out.

825
00:49:30,793 --> 00:49:31,886
Hey.

826
00:49:31,928 --> 00:49:34,681
Your car was involved
in a robbery tonight.

827
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:36,099
No, it wasn't. I-I had it.

828
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,975
I don't know nothing about any robbery.

829
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:40,311
Just confess.

830
00:49:42,111 --> 00:49:43,271
Why are you doing this

831
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:45,316
to me, lady? Ain't you
supposed to be a hero?

832
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:46,901
I am a hero.

833
00:49:46,943 --> 00:49:49,570
For killing a black
piece of shit like you.

834
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:06,212
I wanted to go to the police.

835
00:50:06,254 --> 00:50:08,631
But my folks,

836
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:11,217
they thought it was pointless.

837
00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:13,261
So when that man from Vought,

838
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:17,348
when he showed up and he offered
us that money, we just took it.

839
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:21,185
$2,000.

840
00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:24,605
That is what my
brother's life was worth.

841
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:27,775
Just $2,000.

842
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:29,777
But y'all have got to promise me

843
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:32,780
that you won't tell anybody that
I sat here and I talked to you.

844
00:50:32,822 --> 00:50:35,616
Because if that woman finds
out that I opened my mouth,

845
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:37,034
she's gonna kill me.

846
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:39,036
Ms. Hunter,

847
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:42,582
that woman, L-Liberty,

848
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:45,793
n-nobody's seen her since 1979.

849
00:50:45,835 --> 00:50:47,378
I mean, she's probably dead by now.

850
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:49,213
Oh, no, no.

851
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:51,424
I...

852
00:50:58,222 --> 00:51:00,183
Right here.

853
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:02,894
That's her. Right there.

854
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:04,854
That's Liberty.

855
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:11,903
Valerie was just a little girl,

856
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:14,405
and she said it was raining,
so she could be wrong.

857
00:51:14,447 --> 00:51:16,157
She seemed pretty certain.

858
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:18,534
Yeah, but if Liberty and
Stormfront are the same person,

859
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:20,896
then that makes Stormfront,
like, what, like, 70 years old?

860
00:51:20,897 --> 00:51:22,119
- More?
- Yeah, but who knows

861
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,122
what Compound V can do?

862
00:51:23,164 --> 00:51:26,334
I mean, maybe she doesn't age
like a regular person. Okay?

863
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:28,127
This is the same Stormfront
that just became

864
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:30,046
- America's favorite two-fisted Supe.
- Mm-hmm.

865
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,673
And might've popped Raynor's
head for getting too close.

866
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:35,510
- Oh, my God.
- What the fuck is going on?

867
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:44,769
I didn't know that about your dad.

868
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:48,731
Sounds like he was a real hero.

869
00:51:48,773 --> 00:51:52,235
I thought so, but...

870
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:57,073
Nah. He's just a man with a disease.

871
00:51:57,114 --> 00:52:00,034
He passed it down to me,
and if I'm not too careful,

872
00:52:00,076 --> 00:52:02,912
I might end up passing it down to my...

873
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:44,537
Who the fuck do you think you are?

874
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:47,331
What, you think I don't see it?

875
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:50,585
Trying to undermine me, steal my team...

876
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:52,506
- Hold on a minute.
- Let me tell you right now,

877
00:52:52,507 --> 00:52:54,881
it won't work.

878
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:57,967
I'm the face of the Seven! Not you!

879
00:52:58,009 --> 00:53:01,012
Me. I still score higher in
every demo that counts.

880
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:04,682
18 to 34, 18 to 49, 25 to 54,

881
00:53:04,724 --> 00:53:08,102
they all love me.

882
00:53:08,144 --> 00:53:11,105
Well, congratulations.

883
00:53:11,147 --> 00:53:15,318
I mean, this constant need
to be loved by everyone

884
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:19,530
is kind of pathetic, but, um, yay.

885
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:27,371
Okay.

886
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:31,083
Okay. Calm down.

887
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:34,378
I clearly pushed you
a little far. I'm sorry.

888
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:37,924
Look, I'm... I'm just trying to help.

889
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:40,468
Really? How?

890
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:43,095
By taking what's mine?

891
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:45,014
Let me tell you something right now:

892
00:53:45,056 --> 00:53:46,891
I built this team from the ground up,

893
00:53:46,933 --> 00:53:49,477
and there is no fucking way that anyone

894
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:50,978
is gonna take it away from me.

895
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,606
You spent $273 million

896
00:53:53,648 --> 00:53:55,358
on that "Saving America" bullshit,

897
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:57,151
and I am running circles around you

898
00:53:57,193 --> 00:54:00,488
with five guys on laptops
churning out memes.

899
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:03,532
I practically pay them
with Arby's gift cards.

900
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:05,493
You...

901
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:08,037
You can't win the whole country anymore.

902
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,039
No one can.

903
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:12,416
So why are you even trying?

904
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:16,087
You don't need 50 million
people to love you.

905
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:20,132
You need five million
people fucking pissed.

906
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:23,386
Emotion sells, anger sells.

907
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:25,638
You have fans.

908
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,974
I have soldiers.

909
00:54:29,976 --> 00:54:33,062
Look, I know that

910
00:54:33,104 --> 00:54:36,440
you probably won't believe this.

911
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:38,567
I think that you

912
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:40,611
are the best of us.

913
00:54:42,655 --> 00:54:44,240
I think that you

914
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:49,036
are everything we should be.

915
00:54:49,078 --> 00:54:52,957
You just need a little help
connecting with your audience.

916
00:54:55,001 --> 00:54:57,128
You know, change with the times.

917
00:54:57,169 --> 00:54:59,422
God knows I did.

918
00:55:07,096 --> 00:55:10,516
I don't need help connecting
with my audience.

919
00:55:11,726 --> 00:55:12,977
Thank you.

920
00:55:13,019 --> 00:55:15,688
Okay. Well, just know I'm always here,

921
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:19,734
door is always open for anything.

922
00:55:33,122 --> 00:55:35,124
You're late. Where's the kid?

923
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:42,548
Babe, we got to get in the
truck or we'll miss our chance.

924
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:43,900
I'm-I'm not leaving.

925
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:45,792
What are you talking
about? Of course you are.

926
00:55:45,793 --> 00:55:46,927
Grab the kid and let's go.

927
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:48,649
You don't really want
Ryan to come with us.

928
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:50,514
Of course I do. I said
I'd take him, didn't I?

929
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:52,975
And I wanted to believe you.

930
00:55:54,643 --> 00:55:59,023
Then believe me. Now come on,
we've got to get a shift on.

931
00:55:59,065 --> 00:56:01,442
Listen, if the three of us leave,

932
00:56:01,484 --> 00:56:04,111
you're gonna find a
way to get rid of him.

933
00:56:04,153 --> 00:56:05,529
I know it.

934
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:07,852
It won't be in an obvious way,
and it won't be right away,

935
00:56:07,853 --> 00:56:09,093
- but you will.
- No, Becca, no.

936
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:11,494
Billy, I know you. I know
you better than anybody,

937
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:13,370
and I saw it in your face last night.

938
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:15,331
I see it now.

939
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:23,130
He's a billion-dollar piece
of Vought property.

940
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:26,967
They are not gonna let him go.

941
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:32,473
You and me, Becca, you and
me, we've got a chance.

942
00:56:32,515 --> 00:56:35,017
Babe, it's Ryan they care about, not us.

943
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:36,560
Yeah, and then what?

944
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:38,813
And then Vought raises him
without a mother, right?

945
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:40,414
Then we have Homelander all over again,

946
00:56:40,416 --> 00:56:42,296
then there's two fucking
assholes in this world.

947
00:56:42,297 --> 00:56:44,568
We could disappear, all
right? Just start again,

948
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,195
- start a new family.
- I have a son!

949
00:56:46,237 --> 00:56:47,947
He's a fucking Supe freak.

950
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:52,743
Fuck. I'm... Listen, I...

951
00:56:52,785 --> 00:56:56,163
I'm sorry, I d... I didn't mean that.

952
00:56:56,205 --> 00:56:58,582
Becca.

953
00:56:58,624 --> 00:57:01,293
Becca, please come with me.

954
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:04,713
You were wrong about
me, do you know that?

955
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:06,966
You put me on this pedestal,

956
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:10,970
and the truth is, I never
knew how to save you.

957
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:13,222
You were always one-one bad day away

958
00:57:13,264 --> 00:57:15,432
from pounding someone
to death in a parking lot.

959
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:17,476
That's not true.

960
00:57:18,811 --> 00:57:21,313
Billy.

961
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:24,900
He raped me, and when I
found out I was pregnant,

962
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:27,903
I went to Vought.

963
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:29,530
I didn't come to you.

964
00:57:31,699 --> 00:57:34,910
I didn't come to you
because I was scared,

965
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:36,704
'cause I knew that you'd chase after him

966
00:57:36,745 --> 00:57:40,249
and you would seek revenge and
it wouldn't be good for anybody.

967
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:41,500
I love you.

968
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:43,544
I love you.

969
00:57:45,546 --> 00:57:48,090
But the hate that you carry

970
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:51,552
and the warpath that you're on,

971
00:57:51,594 --> 00:57:54,263
it started so long before me.

972
00:57:56,307 --> 00:57:57,850
I can't.

973
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:11,447
Becs, I'm not leaving without you.

974
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,908
You have to go, please.

975
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:17,244
Every guard in this goddamn place

976
00:58:17,286 --> 00:58:20,206
is gonna be here in 60 seconds.

977
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:24,043
You have to go.

978
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:26,879
I'm sorry.

979
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:29,840
I'm so sorry.

980
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:48,192
Oh, shit.

981
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:02,498
- Small token of the trip.
- Mmm.

982
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,750
You know, John Wayne Gacy
used to give those out to kids

983
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:05,952
when he was a birthday clown.

984
00:59:05,953 --> 00:59:08,087
Whatever, I still love them.

985
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:10,673
Thanks for letting me come.

986
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:12,299
It was fun

987
00:59:12,341 --> 00:59:16,387
- until it got so horrible.
- Yeah.

988
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:19,348
What can I say? It's my specialty.

989
00:59:20,391 --> 00:59:22,768
Well, um,

990
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:26,355
listen, if you're ever in the
mood for another Almond Joy,

991
00:59:26,397 --> 00:59:28,565
just-just shoot me a text.

992
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:30,192
That came out so gross. I'm sorry.

993
00:59:30,234 --> 00:59:32,236
Hughie...

994
00:59:33,612 --> 00:59:35,572
we can't do that again.

995
00:59:35,614 --> 00:59:39,576
No, no, no, no. No, we can't.

996
00:59:39,618 --> 00:59:40,995
Why, though?

997
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:44,373
I mean, th... this is... this is good.

998
00:59:44,415 --> 00:59:46,250
But that's just it.

999
00:59:46,292 --> 00:59:51,130
I mean, we can't afford to
feel good or to feel safe

1000
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:53,257
or to let our guard down.

1001
00:59:53,299 --> 00:59:55,134
You can't go through this on your own.

1002
00:59:57,011 --> 00:59:59,013
We're all alone.

1003
01:00:00,139 --> 01:00:02,850
That's the truth.

1004
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:05,311
But it doesn't have to be like that.

1005
01:00:13,444 --> 01:00:15,446
Goodbye, Hughie.

1006
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:38,510
I believe the secret
to a great relationship

1007
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:41,430
is to be willing...

1008
01:00:41,472 --> 01:00:44,350
to do anything for your man.

1009
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:46,810
Anything.

1010
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:48,479
I'm a feminist,

1011
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:52,649
but I'm also very sexual,

1012
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:55,819
and I don't see that as contradictory.

1013
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:59,948
What's wrong with giving pleasure

1014
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,992
and receiving it?

1015
01:01:02,034 --> 01:01:05,329
Thank you for coming in, Gianna.

1016
01:01:05,371 --> 01:01:08,207
Yeah, we appreciate your candor.

1017
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:10,000
Thank you so much.

1018
01:01:10,042 --> 01:01:12,419
Anytime. It was really
great meeting you.

1019
01:01:12,461 --> 01:01:13,670
Really great.

1020
01:01:13,712 --> 01:01:15,839
So great.

1021
01:01:20,427 --> 01:01:23,555
Bye.

1022
01:01:23,597 --> 01:01:26,642
Her. Gianna. I choose her.

1023
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,936
I mean, she's the one, no question.

1024
01:01:28,977 --> 01:01:30,979
No, she isn't.

1025
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:32,189
Wait, what?

1026
01:01:32,231 --> 01:01:34,274
She was, like, hands down the winner.

1027
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:35,943
It was not even a contest.

1028
01:01:35,984 --> 01:01:37,861
It's Cassandra.

1029
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:40,989
Cassandra? The one...
the one with the hair

1030
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:42,991
and the creepy skeletons
hugging each other story?

1031
01:01:42,992 --> 01:01:44,201
Yes.

1032
01:01:44,243 --> 01:01:45,577
That's your wife.

1033
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:49,123
Oh... But...

1034
01:01:49,164 --> 01:01:51,125
but I thought I got to choose.

1035
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:54,378
You do, and you're choosing Cassandra.

1036
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:56,171
Congratulations.

1037
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:59,675
Yeah, but, I mean, Gianna...

1038
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:03,720
Is lovely. She's lovely. She's a
valued member of the Collective,

1039
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:05,514
but this marriage isn't about

1040
01:02:05,556 --> 01:02:08,016
satisfying your base desires.

1041
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:10,561
It's about rehabilitating your image

1042
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:12,688
and getting you back in the Seven.

1043
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:15,315
That is what you want, isn't it?

1044
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:37,129
There you are.

1045
01:02:43,594 --> 01:02:46,013
I was beginning to worry.

1046
01:02:54,897 --> 01:02:57,107
Oh, I missed you.

1047
01:03:01,653 --> 01:03:03,864
Are you thirsty?

1048
01:03:05,991 --> 01:03:07,409
Want some?

1049
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:13,457
Aw, I want you so bad.

1050
01:03:20,339 --> 01:03:22,841
Are you okay?

1051
01:03:22,883 --> 01:03:25,344
Would you like me to be someone else?

1052
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:28,222
I can be whoever you want.

1053
01:03:35,646 --> 01:03:37,814
No.

1054
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:41,860
I don't need anyone...

1055
01:03:44,029 --> 01:03:46,031
...but myself.

1056
01:04:01,129 --> 01:04:04,466
Like what you see?

1057
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:07,511
See how hot you are?

1058
01:04:08,762 --> 01:04:10,347
Hmm?

1059
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:14,768
Come on.

1060
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,814
How much do you want this?

1061
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,859
How much?

1062
01:04:31,159 --> 01:04:34,246
I'm gonna suck your
cock so fucking hard,

1063
01:04:34,288 --> 01:04:37,082
so good,

1064
01:04:37,124 --> 01:04:40,502
and you're gonna look in
your own eyes when you come.

1065
01:04:42,004 --> 01:04:44,464
It's not even gay

1066
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:47,384
if it's with yourself, right?

1067
01:04:48,844 --> 01:04:51,972
Oh,

1068
01:04:52,014 --> 01:04:54,891
you're so special,

1069
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:58,020
the most special man

1070
01:04:58,061 --> 01:05:00,355
on the planet.

1071
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:04,359
Everybody loves you.

1072
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:07,237
Everybody.

1073
01:05:07,279 --> 01:05:09,906
Their love

1074
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:13,285
is your strength.

1075
01:05:24,087 --> 01:05:27,007
You're pathetic.

1076
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:42,230
I don't need everyone to love me.

1077
01:05:43,899 --> 01:05:45,734
I don't need anyone.

1078
01:05:50,656 --> 01:05:52,783
I don't

1079
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:55,869
need you!

1080
01:06:11,068 --> 01:06:16,068
