2
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,309
Holy shit!

3
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,853
We are going to hold hearings

4
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:21,230
on Vought and Compound V!

5
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:23,733
I'm the world's greatest superhero.

6
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,985
You're my greatest failure.

7
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,445
I do like you.

8
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:28,654
You've got spunk.

9
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:30,448
You're gonna be a big help to me.

10
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:32,616
What the hell does that mean?

11
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,786
That's fucking Lamplighter.

12
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:37,121
These people are test subjects.

13
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:38,539
They're trying to stabilize the V.

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,709
Anywhere, anytime, you get a solid Supe.

15
00:00:41,731 --> 00:00:42,731
Why would Vought do that?

16
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,128
We are in a war.

17
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,588
For the culture.

18
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,131
But we can fight back

19
00:00:47,173 --> 00:00:49,925
with an army of
supermen millions strong.

20
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:52,636
Everyone I have ever
loved is in the ground.

21
00:00:54,597 --> 00:00:56,307
And then I found you.

22
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:57,725
We found each other.

23
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,068
30% of the public

24
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:08,903
is hard-core aware now

25
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:10,738
and know how the system works.

26
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,282
And then we don't do anything about it.

27
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:17,411
That's why Super terrorists
continue to invade America.

28
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:20,122
There are illegal immigrants
pouring into this country

29
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:22,666
every day, and any one of
them could be a Super terrorist.

30
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:26,253
Many are calling for more
superheroes in order to counter

31
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:28,739
the Super terrorist threat
and protect Americans.

32
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,010
What is our government doing about this?

33
00:01:30,011 --> 00:01:31,282
- Got to go. I'm late for class.
- Thanks.

34
00:01:31,283 --> 00:01:32,843
- All of us...
- Have a good day, hon.

35
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:34,345
...we need to stand up right now.

36
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,305
I am sick of waiting for some executive

37
00:01:36,347 --> 00:01:37,932
to finish his racket...

38
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,533
We are going to hold hearings

39
00:01:39,534 --> 00:01:41,644
on Vought and Compound V...

40
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:44,063
That's $1.45.

41
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,544
I'm gonna tell you something
I probably shouldn't.

42
00:01:46,545 --> 00:01:47,691
I'm gonna tell you something

43
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,293
that the government doesn't want you...

44
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:50,838
And they want

45
00:01:50,839 --> 00:01:52,488
more Super terrorists. That's...

46
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,251
Many people are pointing out that
the rush to judgment by the left...

47
00:01:55,252 --> 00:01:57,292
- Victoria Neuman's accusation that...
- No offense.

48
00:01:57,293 --> 00:01:58,668
- I get you have your talking points...
- Have a good day, hon.

49
00:01:58,669 --> 00:02:00,287
...but why does it matter

50
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,248
what some supervillain-loving
snowflake has...

51
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:05,209
Every minute we waste...

52
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:06,836
One Super terrorist

53
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,671
has already gotten
through. More will come.

54
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:12,258
- That's $1.45.
- And, I mean, for all we know...

55
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,593
these maniacs could have already flown

56
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,470
over our borders and be standing next

57
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:18,247
- to you right now...
- You all right, pal?

58
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:19,929
- ...just waiting for their chance
- Yeah.

59
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:20,930
...to kill us all.

60
00:02:20,931 --> 00:02:23,091
Keep America safe
again. And I am so glad

61
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,903
that I was there this
time. But what about...

62
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:30,201
- I am counting on you.
- Have a good day, hon.

63
00:02:30,242 --> 00:02:31,643
Every minute we wait...

64
00:02:31,644 --> 00:02:32,644
No, it's up to us.

65
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,780
We have to make our voices heard.

66
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:45,082
I am counting on you

67
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:46,667
to show us the way.

68
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,627
Don't let me down.

69
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:49,753
Hey.

70
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,801
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

71
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,261
I saw the light in your eyes.

72
00:02:57,303 --> 00:02:59,179
- Just-just take the money.
- You one of them?

73
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,307
- You a fuckin' supervillain?
- What?

74
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,388
- Are you a bulletproof motherfucker?!
- No. Please.

75
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,102
I have a family. Please.

76
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:17,823
♪ What a wonderful world ♪

77
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:23,537
♪ What a wonderful world. ♪

78
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,450
Look, I told you.

79
00:03:27,451 --> 00:03:28,626
Stormfront gave the orders.

80
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:29,960
I just executed them.

81
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:31,545
It was, um...

82
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:33,130
- It wasn't easy.
- Yeah,

83
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:35,453
I think we can all agree that
you're the real victim here.

84
00:03:35,454 --> 00:03:38,052
Now, let's cut the shit
and go over it again.

85
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,179
- From the start.
- I had just left the Seven.

86
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,890
And Mr. Edgar invited me to his club.

87
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:44,516
Put away that petulant look

88
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,644
- before you hurt someone with it.
- Yeah,

89
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,205
I should be chuffed we're pissin' away

90
00:03:48,206 --> 00:03:50,022
the best asset we ever got our mitts on.

91
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:51,744
- And your plan would be?
- Same as always.

92
00:03:51,745 --> 00:03:53,651
Squeeze the cunt till he
gives up the next cunt,

93
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,092
then kill the fuck when we're done.

94
00:03:55,133 --> 00:03:56,333
I have no doubt you'd be happy

95
00:03:56,334 --> 00:03:58,522
with that unending cycle of brutality.

96
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,784
How can you not want
blood for what he done?

97
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:04,286
He's willing to speak against
Vought at the hearing.

98
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:06,538
We've never had Congress
on our side before.

99
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,207
Congress. Please.

100
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,125
What a bunch of corrupt
fucking cunts they are.

101
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,767
Oh, come on, you're not the first person

102
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:13,420
to call me a cunt, Mr. Butcher.

103
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,881
I'm starting to think it's
like a... badge of honor.

104
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,800
Term of endearment
where I come from, love.

105
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,635
Mm.

106
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:20,761
Well?

107
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:22,930
Opposition's gonna have
a field day with him.

108
00:04:22,972 --> 00:04:25,099
Disgruntled ex-Supe? I am fairly sure

109
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,559
he's fucked half the Sacred
Heart cheerleading squad.

110
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,103
But, yeah, he'll be a good witness.

111
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,312
It's not enough, though.

112
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:32,272
Not enough? If torturing and burning

113
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:33,941
a bunch of mentals on Vought's say-so

114
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:35,192
ain't enough for you muppets,

115
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:36,902
then what the fuck
are you good for, huh?

116
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:39,304
- A strongly worded tweet?
- You're a wanted felon, asshole.

117
00:04:39,305 --> 00:04:41,207
- We don't need your help.
- Yes, we do, Lisa.

118
00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:43,742
Mr. Butcher here has fought
Vought harder than we ever have.

119
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,327
But I would like a turn.

120
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:48,163
If we can... trust each other.

121
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,332
Uh, I think we can.

122
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:51,959
- Trust each other.
- Hold still.

123
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:53,377
What do you need?

124
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,087
Okay, we know what they
were doing at Sage Grove,

125
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:57,806
but we don't know why.

126
00:04:57,847 --> 00:04:59,758
Why test Compound V on patients?

127
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,261
What do they want?
I need the full picture.

128
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,346
If we're gonna take a shot at the king,

129
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:05,764
we can't fucking miss.

130
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:09,435
We know someone who
might know the full picture.

131
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,603
Oh, well, that's fucking rich, isn't it?

132
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:12,646
Who is it?

133
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:14,273
Like you said...

134
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,316
we're gonna have to trust each other.

135
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,281
Would you like a coffee?

136
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,074
Um, no, thanks.

137
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:26,577
How 'bout a white
chocolate unicorn frappe?

138
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,412
- They're really good.
- No.

139
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:30,372
- I'll get one to share.
- Mom, I don't want

140
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:32,499
a fucking unicorn frappé.

141
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,460
Okay. Sorry.

142
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,630
J-Just nervous.

143
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:42,051
When did you get to town?

144
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,262
I never left.

145
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:48,265
I've been staying at
the Days Inn in Newark.

146
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:50,642
I'm not leaving until we talk this out.

147
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,312
I know what I've done to you.

148
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,147
Believe me, I know.

149
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,399
Mom, it's not just you.

150
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,485
It's...

151
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:03,822
Do you remember that...

152
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,617
cross that you gave me for confirmation?

153
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:09,328
Before every save that I went on,

154
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,705
I would touch it.

155
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,415
Like a...

156
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:16,585
football player leaving a locker room.

157
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:19,838
I thought that God was
sending me on a mission.

158
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,092
I feel so stupid.

159
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:27,554
I gave my whole life to nothing.

160
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,181
That's not true.

161
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,808
Mom...

162
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:32,726
the good guys don't win.

163
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:35,354
The bad guys don't get punished.

164
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,356
What we do means nothing.

165
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,359
It's just all for money and...

166
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,280
I am in the middle of all of it.

167
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,865
Alone.

168
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,867
Honey, you're not alone.

169
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,160
You're not.

170
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:53,038
Let's go away,

171
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,289
you and me.

172
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,811
Let's-let's get away from all of this,

173
00:06:55,812 --> 00:06:56,834
get away from Vought.

174
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,169
Escape for a while, hmm?

175
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,838
I cleared it already.

176
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,007
You cleared what?

177
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,717
W-With Ashley at Vought.

178
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,094
You called them?

179
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:08,262
Y-Yeah, about an hour ago.

180
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:09,388
- Why?
- Mom,

181
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,098
th-they could be looking for m...

182
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,143
Mom!

183
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,779
Colonel, you think the
congresswoman is in danger?

184
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,406
She has her security detail.

185
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,284
Which will be useless
if a Supe drops in.

186
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,078
She's our best chance to nail Vought,

187
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,914
but only if you keep her
alive until the hearing.

188
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,333
Oui, madame.

189
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,918
And, Serge...

190
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,673
...no abandoning your post this time.

191
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,552
Oui, madame.

192
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,724
Hey.

193
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,143
I'm-I'm all right. I'm coming with you.

194
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:58,437
You're in no shape to go anywhere.

195
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,024
Besides, we got a very
important job for you.

196
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:05,068
We need you to look
after our star witness.

197
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,445
Hey.

198
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,780
You guys want to watch
"Deep Does It in the Blowhole"?

199
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,157
You ready to get wet?

200
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,367
I don't want to watch that... film.

201
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,369
It's a classic. You'll love it.

202
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,331
Butcher, let's go.

203
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,001
Hello, Mum.

204
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,754
Hey, Billy,

205
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,422
you ain't been picking up.

206
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:27,424
Yeah, we're in a meeting.

207
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:29,593
I-I'm in New York.

208
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:34,514
Look, I told Judy to tell
you not to fucking come.

209
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:35,933
Oh. Language.

210
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,768
It's a bleedin' expensive plane ticket.

211
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,728
All right? And I ain't
got the time to just...

212
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,397
Billy, he's dead.

213
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,441
Your father's dead.

214
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:48,445
You there?

215
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:49,863
When did that happen?

216
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:52,074
Can I see you, please?

217
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,368
I need to see you right now.

218
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,100
Let me out!

219
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:22,437
God.

220
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,070
Please, God.

221
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,867
Please let me out. Please.

222
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,244
Come on, man, stop.

223
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:38,954
It's not cool.

224
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:41,623
Guess you should've made your wife come,

225
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,208
snowflake cuck.

226
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,922
You know, you don't need the discs.

227
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,340
You can just download these.

228
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:51,967
Uh, what do you want to watch next?

229
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:54,720
Uh, "Translucent: The Invisible Cock".

230
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,389
"Queen Maeve: Pleasure Slave".

231
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,391
Yeah. "Big Black Noir".

232
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,393
Oh. "Starlight Pulls an A-Train".

233
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,645
I'm good. I'm good. Thank you.

234
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,522
Okay.

235
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:07,274
Different strokes, man.

236
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:09,067
Please don't say that in this context.

237
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,028
I should just get up and leave.

238
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:14,114
But you like watching
Homebanger fuck me, don't you?

239
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:15,782
You know, this isn't healthy, man.

240
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:19,036
Y-You can't watch porn
while the... sun's out.

241
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,246
Look, if I get up at that
hearing, I'm dead anyway.

242
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,748
What difference does it make?

243
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,542
Okay.

244
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:28,462
Drop the remote, or I'll
burn your fucking face off.

245
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:35,427
Uh...

246
00:10:35,429 --> 00:10:36,909
Want me to fuck your wife

247
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,597
like she deserves, cuck?

248
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:42,017
Did you know I was a prodigy?

249
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,770
A fucking prodigy.

250
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,897
I lit my first fire at four.

251
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:49,149
Burned my whole house down.

252
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:51,568
My dad...

253
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,612
he was so proud.

254
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,989
"My son's a Supe".

255
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,203
I was gonna do great things.

256
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,080
I almost did.

257
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,123
Now look at me.

258
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,626
I'm like the cuck in the porn,

259
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,628
sitting on the sidelines

260
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,339
while the real heroes are
out there doing the fucking.

261
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:18,470
You want to know why they
left me to babysit you?

262
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,932
Because you're useless?

263
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,271
My mom... she, uh...

264
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,608
Never mind.

265
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:36,321
After... she was gone,

266
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,824
I watched my dad do...

267
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,243
nothing his whole life.

268
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,412
But me...

269
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,664
I thought I'd finally found...

270
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,124
something.

271
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:50,210
I thought I found what
I was meant to do.

272
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,588
But it turns out I'm...

273
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,133
shit at that as well.

274
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,760
You're not the cuck.

275
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:01,721
I'm... the cuck.

276
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:04,683
Actually, you're worse.

277
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,560
You're the cuck fluffer.

278
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,159
Hey-hey!

279
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,278
What's up?

280
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,530
How y'all doing out there?

281
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:19,948
Good to see you!

282
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:24,953
- Yeah!
- All right!

283
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:27,038
Hey, do me a favor.

284
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,582
Who's the real heroes?

285
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,709
You are!

286
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,503
Thank you! I just want to be clear.

287
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:35,130
No one condones the tragic shooting

288
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:36,423
at the convenience store.

289
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:37,799
Our thoughts and prayers go out

290
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,509
to Kuldeep Singh's family.

291
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,886
And we are making a donation

292
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,679
to Samaritan's Embrace in his name.

293
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:44,181
Absolutely.

294
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,849
Thoughts and prayers.

295
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:47,601
But...

296
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:49,686
that doesn't change facts.

297
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:52,939
This used to be a-a beautiful country.

298
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,274
- Remember?
- Yeah!

299
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:56,526
One nation under God.

300
00:12:56,548 --> 00:12:57,548
Remember?

301
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,905
Right before these godless,

302
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:03,742
inhuman supervillains started
pouring across our borders

303
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,620
and dragging us down into their mud.

304
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:12,125
What do SJWs like Victoria
Neuman want us to do?

305
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:15,170
Just let 'em in and give
'em a cup of iced tea?

306
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,922
And then punish us

307
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,924
- for trying to stop them.
- That's right.

308
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,551
Has there ever been anyone
in history more persecuted

309
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:24,179
just for trying to protect their own?

310
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,182
We are at war!

311
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:28,824
- Yeah!
- We need more Compound V.

312
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:29,845
- Absolutely.
- Yeah!

313
00:13:29,868 --> 00:13:32,755
- We need more Supes!
- More Supes!

314
00:13:32,796 --> 00:13:34,876
- More Supes! More Supes!
- We need more superheroes!

315
00:13:34,877 --> 00:13:36,149
More Supes! More Supes!

316
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:38,568
- More Supes! More...
- Now,

317
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,779
I've always been honest
with you... you know that.

318
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,322
And I got to be honest with you now.

319
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:44,407
It brings me no pleasure
to tell you this,

320
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,410
but we also had a mole in the Seven.

321
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,828
That's right.

322
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,247
One of our own.

323
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:52,290
Starlight.

324
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:55,418
I know, I know. It's okay.

325
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,628
She's been apprehended,

326
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,713
and she can't hurt anyone else.

327
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,633
I can't believe this.

328
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,677
Put 'em in. All of 'em.

329
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,845
I want all of 'em in at the same time.

330
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,138
Okay, this is insane.

331
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,265
- Hey.
- No.

332
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,558
Fuck yes...

333
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:12,561
Starlight has been
conspiring with the people

334
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,271
who murdered, in cold blood,

335
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,940
- my brother...
- Oh, my God, fuck.

336
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:18,900
...the hero Translucent.

337
00:14:18,902 --> 00:14:20,422
If you are just tuning in...

338
00:14:20,423 --> 00:14:22,404
Um, uh...

339
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,845
- I bet you she's in 42D.
- You have reached

340
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,104
- the voice mailbox...
- Come on, Butcher, where are you?

341
00:14:27,105 --> 00:14:28,877
And that is if she's
still alive, which...

342
00:14:28,878 --> 00:14:29,928
Wait, wait, wait,

343
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,204
- what's 42D?
- At the Tower.

344
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:32,747
Supe-proof, mostly.

345
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,958
- Steel walls six feet thick.
- How do I get in?

346
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,626
Into the Tower? Yeah, you don't.

347
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:37,919
And I'm sorry, man, but...

348
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,041
- she's probably dead.
- There's got to be something.

349
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:41,715
Right? Like a... like a secret entrance?

350
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,009
Maybe one or two, but
forget it, man. It's crazy.

351
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,176
Okay, show me. Come with me.

352
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,678
Look at you. You're still fucked up.

353
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,200
Which is exactly why I need your help.

354
00:14:48,201 --> 00:14:49,931
Get... your... friends.

355
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:51,099
Butcher isn't picking up,

356
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:52,861
and the others are
halfway across the state.

357
00:14:52,862 --> 00:14:55,437
We got to go! Now!

358
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:58,356
Listen, Vought screwed you over, right?

359
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,718
Well, now they're trying to do
the exact same thing to her.

360
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:03,361
This shit is over for me.

361
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,197
My whole life is over, okay?

362
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,825
This is your last chance
to be a hero again.

363
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,460
Come on, I mean,

364
00:15:10,502 --> 00:15:12,983
do you-you want to be the cuck
or do you want to be the...

365
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,206
guy who fucks the wife?

366
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,633
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

367
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,176
Let's go fuck the wife.

368
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,345
Consensually. Come on, come on.

369
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,524
Hello, Mum.

370
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:49,949
Will you come with me?

371
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,165
Now, don't hate me.

372
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:58,958
Why would I hate you?

373
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,053
Look, I'm sorry. It was my idea,

374
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,097
but you wouldn't come any other way.

375
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,598
Look, look, look, look, don't.

376
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,767
- He hasn't got much time.
- Not my problem.

377
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,609
That's yours, 'cause you
stayed with the cunt.

378
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,187
Have I ever asked you for anything?

379
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:20,814
Ever?

380
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,036
William.

381
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,456
Ah.

382
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:42,377
What, no hug?

383
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:44,379
You step one inch closer,

384
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:47,090
and I'll kill you quicker than
that fucking ass cancer.

385
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:49,801
I'll bet you would.

386
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:53,012
I seen on the news where you
topped that Stillwell slag.

387
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,681
It weren't me.

388
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:56,516
But thanks for your support.

389
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,060
Please, please.

390
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,438
I just want to talk.

391
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:09,404
Two minutes.

392
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,163
You been following the Ashes?

393
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,749
You want to talk about fucking cricket?

394
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,169
You remember the '83 World Cup?

395
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,171
I took you to every match...

396
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,297
Leeds,

397
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:28,673
Old Trafford.

398
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,175
You loved it.

399
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:33,428
Do you know why I loved it?

400
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,347
'Cause you'd get on the
piss with your loser mates.

401
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,350
And I could fuck off for
hours and you'd never know.

402
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,144
Yeah, well, let's not do this then, eh?

403
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:42,437
Yeah, let's not.

404
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:45,106
I know I was no perfect father.

405
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:48,568
But I know I never got a chance
to say goodbye to Lenny.

406
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,069
And I don't want that with you.

407
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,530
Didn't have a chance to
say goodbye to Lenny?

408
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,199
You're the fucking reason he's dead.

409
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,534
Let me tell you something, William.

410
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,578
It's a shit world out there.

411
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,372
You count on no one but yourself.

412
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,374
You either sink or you swim,

413
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,043
and, in Lenny's case,

414
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,795
he chose to sink.

415
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,422
You don't have the fucking right

416
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,049
to mention his name.

417
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,469
I fucking loved Lenny.

418
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,888
But he wasn't hard like you.

419
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,010
That's why you're still here
and he's dead, isn't it?

420
00:18:19,011 --> 00:18:21,893
You beat the fucking shit out
of the both of us, didn't you?

421
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,020
Maybe I pushed you a bit hard.

422
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:26,189
But look at you.

423
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:28,071
- Get the fuck off...
- You afraid of anything?

424
00:18:28,072 --> 00:18:29,526
No.

425
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,611
Are you the strongest bastard you know?

426
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:33,655
Yeah.

427
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:38,243
Tougher than I ever was.

428
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:43,790
Oh, you're welcome, asshole.

429
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,295
Yeah.

430
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,923
Lenny stuck that gun in his mouth

431
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,133
when you couldn't hack it anymore

432
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:58,221
and you pissed off to join
the SAS like a right cunt.

433
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:00,139
You're the one who abandoned him,

434
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:01,933
not me.

435
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:09,691
You're a fucking monster.

436
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:10,817
It takes one to know one.

437
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:12,110
Billy, for God's sake!

438
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,820
Pack it in! Pack it in!

439
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:15,238
Stop!

440
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,656
Jesus.

441
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:19,826
Christ, what have you done?

442
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:22,328
See?

443
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,831
Lenny could never have done that.

444
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:27,584
Christ. Billy.

445
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,754
Jesus.

446
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,427
All right, guys.

447
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,749
- Sorry, we gotta go.
- All right, guys. Thanks very much.

448
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,309
- Take care, God bless.
- God bless.

449
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,600
- I'm telling you... it's a mistake.
- What is?

450
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,810
Keeping fucking Starlight alive.

451
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:48,354
Hey. Yeah.

452
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:52,984
I underestimated her before.

453
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,569
I will not do it again.

454
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:56,988
"Starlight is a traitor"
is trending number one.

455
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,324
And we've got a million tweets
in support of Compound V.

456
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,242
A common enemy rallies the base.

457
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:03,036
Just trust me.

458
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:04,871
All right.

459
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:08,082
And if I can get my
hands on Hugh Campbell,

460
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,604
maybe pull his little spine out
the back of his fucking neck...

461
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:13,922
You okay?

462
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,757
Yeah, I just, um...

463
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,884
Your daughter?

464
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:20,887
Yeah.

465
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:25,016
80 years ago, she
looked exactly like that.

466
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,644
Sometimes it feels like yesterday.

467
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:36,611
I got something I want to show you.

468
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:40,907
What to finish up the backyard?

469
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:44,452
Okay if I put this person right there?

470
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:48,790
Hey, guys.

471
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,124
Hello.

472
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,376
This is Stormfront.

473
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,836
Stormfront, this is Rebecca.

474
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:57,465
Very nice to meet you.

475
00:20:57,507 --> 00:21:00,134
And this is my son.

476
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,136
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

477
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:05,932
Listen, um...

478
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:07,767
I know, last time, uh,

479
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:10,436
I screwed up big-time, and, um...

480
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,689
and I just want you to
know I'm never, ever

481
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,440
gonna push you that hard again, okay?

482
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,695
All right, well, Ryan,

483
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:21,739
I'd love you to meet my
girlfriend, Stormfront.

484
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,658
Wow, he looks just like you.

485
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,076
You think?

486
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,078
Are you serious? Those eyes?

487
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,371
Hey, Ryan,

488
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,289
your daddy told me all about you.

489
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:33,543
- You have superpowers, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

490
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:36,838
That makes you very, very special.

491
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:41,926
You are the first
natural-born superhero.

492
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,679
Can we not?

493
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,389
That's right. Um...

494
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:47,974
Ryan does have powers,

495
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:51,185
but his mom doesn't like to
talk about them or use them.

496
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,354
Can you also let me know
before you just pop by?

497
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:54,772
He's Ryan's father.

498
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,024
He has a right to see his son.

499
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,109
Uh, that's very true, but, look,

500
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,031
we all just have Ryan's
best interests at heart.

501
00:22:00,032 --> 00:22:01,362
- Right?
- Yes, we do.

502
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:03,656
I'm really sorry I haven't
been here enough.

503
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:06,993
Ryan, uh, I'd really like you
to get to know Stormfront.

504
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:09,203
I would. She's someone
I care about very much,

505
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,413
and, um...

506
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:11,831
I think you will, too.

507
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:14,083
So, I think, uh,

508
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,501
we'll be around more.

509
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,545
A lot more.

510
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:21,340
I want us to be a family.

511
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,514
Hey.

512
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:31,100
Empire Wok.

513
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:32,727
Hi.

514
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:38,107
That was a fraught "hi".

515
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,361
I'm going to my sister's for a while.

516
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,576
I have a plan.

517
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:50,536
You don't need to be
scared of Homelander.

518
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:51,996
That little girl...

519
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:54,040
on the plane.

520
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,878
What she must have gone through
in those last few moments.

521
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,922
I lie awake every night
thinking about that.

522
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,732
- Me, too.
- But then I start snowballing

523
00:23:02,774 --> 00:23:04,716
and wondering... how many other people

524
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,437
have you killed and what
else have you done?

525
00:23:06,438 --> 00:23:08,387
- I didn't have a choice.
- I'm not blaming you.

526
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,848
I'm not. It is not your fault.

527
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,643
Will you just... Will you
s... Will you sit down?

528
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:15,603
- And it's not fair.
- Will you sit down?

529
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:18,940
I wish I were as strong as you.

530
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,650
But I'm not.

531
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,611
I just need time.

532
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:36,374
Over and over, you...

533
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:40,294
You said you wanted to see the real me.

534
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:45,383
This is the real me.

535
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,969
I know.

536
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,388
I'm sorry.

537
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:04,068
Yes?

538
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,945
I'm here to see Jonah.

539
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:08,573
He's not taking any visitors.

540
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,285
Tell him it's Grace Mallory.

541
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:24,797
Goddamn.

542
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:27,717
We're on the wrong team.

543
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:30,887
Moral compromise
does have its privileges.

544
00:24:31,008 --> 00:24:32,008
Grace.

545
00:24:32,529 --> 00:24:33,973
I thought you retired.

546
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:35,391
Dr. Vogelbaum.

547
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:36,642
I thought you were taller.

548
00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:40,897
Sonia, can you get some tea?

549
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:42,982
Thank you, but we won't
be staying long enough.

550
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:46,944
Ah, yes, there's that
WASPy patrician tone.

551
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:48,560
- All business.
- Doc, what do you know

552
00:24:48,561 --> 00:24:49,739
about the Sage Grove Center?

553
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,157
Never heard of it. Should I have?

554
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:53,576
Considering Vought's been
doing illegal tests there

555
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:54,994
since you were the CSO

556
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:56,746
and they're still doing 'em to this day,

557
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:58,623
- seems like you should've.
- That's horrible.

558
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:01,918
Maybe it was Sonnenshine's
project over in R&D.

559
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:04,128
Prick always did have
a real god complex.

560
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,088
Do you recall the deal we made?

561
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,132
In exchange for me graciously dropping

562
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:10,551
certain involuntary
manslaughter charges?

563
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:12,220
I recall it was a long time ago.

564
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,764
Doesn't expire until the
statute of limitations does.

565
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,807
Then I guess I'm turning myself in.

566
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:20,686
We don't have to do this
dance anymore, Jonah.

567
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,481
We're both out.

568
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,316
Just a couple of retirees

569
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:27,485
shooting the shit on the back nine.

570
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,570
We both know Vought fucked you.

571
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:31,989
Probably put you in that chair.

572
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:34,951
Help us fuck 'em back.

573
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:37,411
Testify to Congress.

574
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:42,583
That's my daughter.

575
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:44,710
She took time off from her practice

576
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:46,963
to help a bitter old invalid.

577
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,214
I'm sorry to say this, Grace,

578
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:49,632
but you're the very last person

579
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:51,717
who should be asking me for help.

580
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,177
After what you lost.

581
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:57,598
Do what you like to me.

582
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,644
But some things are more
important than the right thing.

583
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:05,940
He's right, of course.

584
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:08,359
You should listen to him.

585
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:09,777
Ma'am?

586
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:11,612
Go back to your wife and daughter.

587
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:13,948
Nah. I'd just be putting
them in more danger.

588
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,700
Ah, yes,

589
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:18,703
the self-martyring bullshit
of the special ops soldier.

590
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,289
I'll get you all on a
flight to Nicaragua.

591
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,082
No one sees you again.

592
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,752
When this is done, I'll
take you up on that.

593
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:29,088
But that's the point,
Marvin. It's never done.

594
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,090
You just let go.

595
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:32,758
No justice for your father.

596
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,010
No revenge against Vought.

597
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:35,761
You get nothing,

598
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,555
except your family.

599
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:41,058
Go and never come back.

600
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,728
I wish I had.

601
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,943
An angry scene today

602
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:53,362
outside of Congresswoman
Victoria Neuman's residence,

603
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:56,032
as pro- and anti-Vought
protestors clashed

604
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:58,826
just two days before
the House Judiciary...

605
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:05,333
Another. And a pint of bitter.

606
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,795
M.M.

607
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,174
Yeah, good.

608
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,551
How'd it go with Vogelbaum?

609
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:22,224
I'll take care of it.

610
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,354
Send her back! Send her back!

611
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:29,273
Send her back! Send her back!

612
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:34,820
Send her back! Send her
back! Send her back!

613
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:37,615
Life has always been hard,
but I don't remember

614
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,784
it being quite this crude.

615
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,535
I get it.

616
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:43,913
What she's doing with her daughter.

617
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:46,082
My papa... when he...

618
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:48,292
lost his mind,

619
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,044
my mama, she...

620
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:51,587
she kept me cooking with her.

621
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:53,964
Cassoulet, confit de canard,

622
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,425
all the mother sauces.

623
00:27:58,636 --> 00:28:00,513
Cooking has, uh,

624
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:03,474
this way of giving port in a storm.

625
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:06,685
Did your...

626
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:09,438
your mama... she cook?

627
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:13,025
You know...

628
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:17,279
Irvin Yalom... he once
said you, you die twice.

629
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,698
Once, when you stop breathing,

630
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,118
and again when somebody...

631
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,662
utters your name for the last time.

632
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:28,332
I'd like to hear about your family.

633
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:31,127
Keep them alive a bit longer.

634
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:35,881
If you'd ever like to teach me.

635
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:43,722
Point is taken.

636
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:45,015
Never mind.

637
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,075
Gun?

638
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:05,035
I'm saying "gun"?

639
00:29:06,895 --> 00:29:08,831
Très bien.

657
00:29:45,561 --> 00:29:46,911
- Of course.
- A lot.

658
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:47,995
- Yeah, man.
- A lot.

659
00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:50,664
Sweet.

660
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:52,125
- Hey, guys.
- Hey!

661
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,001
- Glad you came.
- Happy birthday.

662
00:29:54,004 --> 00:29:55,604
- Happy birthday.
- Good to see you, too.

663
00:29:55,605 --> 00:29:56,805
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

664
00:29:56,806 --> 00:29:58,002
- Yeah, yeah.
- So...

665
00:29:58,043 --> 00:29:59,465
great news.

666
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:01,717
I've got a meeting with
Stan Edgar next week.

667
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:04,011
- Wow.
- Seriously?

668
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:06,514
With Congress up their ass
and all the shit with Starlight,

669
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:09,558
Vought needs trusted,
proven commodities right now.

670
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,477
- They need you two.
- Yeah.

671
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:13,604
Still got a few deal
points to talk through,

672
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:16,941
but let's just say, they should
be getting your rooms ready.

673
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,609
- For real?
- Honey, this is amazing.

674
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:20,236
- Wow.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

675
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:22,077
- You're welcome.
- This is awesome.

676
00:30:22,078 --> 00:30:25,658
By the way, what do you guys
think of, um, Eagle the Archer?

677
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:27,076
Oh, he's like a brother to me.

678
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:29,411
Yeah, he was there for me
when I was at rock bottom.

679
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:31,413
He's the most kind, loving
person that you ever...

680
00:30:31,414 --> 00:30:34,416
He's a toxic personality,
and no Church members are

681
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:37,336
to have any contact with him whatsoever.

682
00:30:37,378 --> 00:30:39,505
Right. Yeah.

683
00:30:39,547 --> 00:30:42,591
No, now that you mention it,
he did seem pretty toxic. Yeah.

684
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:44,385
Wh-What did he do?

685
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:47,680
Well, he claims the
program had failed him.

686
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:49,807
But actually he failed the program.

687
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,728
- He doesn't exist, you understand?
- Of course.

688
00:30:51,729 --> 00:30:54,562
Ah. Oh, come on.

689
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,146
I think they're gonna do the limbo.

690
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:57,773
- Come on.
- Oh, yeah?

691
00:30:57,815 --> 00:30:59,316
♪ That's the way, uh-huh, uh-huh ♪

692
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,402
♪ I like it, uh-huh, uh-huh ♪

693
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:03,821
♪ That's the way, uh-huh, uh-huh, I... ♪

694
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:13,497
Oh, me and Mr. Marathon used to
sneak college girls in this way.

695
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,082
College girls? Really?

696
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:17,293
They were applying. Yeah.

697
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:19,003
That does not make it better.

698
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:30,097
All right, moment of truth.

699
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:32,099
I'm either still in the system,

700
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:34,184
or we're about to be
swarmed by guards with AKs.

701
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,352
Wait. What?

702
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:44,153
And boom, bitches!

703
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:46,196
All right, let's go.

704
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,911
Maeve?

705
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:54,955
Hello?

706
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,501
What the fuck is this?!

707
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:01,837
This is not lesbian.
This is not on brand.

708
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:03,839
We need you ready for Congress

709
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:05,424
with Elena sitting proudly behind you.

710
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:07,259
She's gone.

711
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:10,179
- What do you mean, she's gone?
- Elena's gone.

712
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:13,390
Okay. Okay.

713
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:15,684
Elena will be back.

714
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:19,647
She will be back in your arms,
and you will be totally fine.

715
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:22,483
You're America's second-favorite
lesbian couple, after all.

716
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:25,819
You know what? Let's just
take a deep breath, okay?

717
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:29,073
Let's just... take a deep
breath here, okay?

718
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,994
We curated a coming-out
story that America loves,

719
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:37,081
- and it would be really good...
- Ashley.

720
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,750
For once in your life,

721
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:42,127
be a fucking human being.

722
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:47,966
I'm really sorry, Maeve.

723
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,439
Michael, that's holding!

724
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:06,110
We're in the middle of
practice, Leigh Anne. Ooh!

725
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:09,113
You can thank me later, Burt.

726
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,031
This team is your family, Michael.

727
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:12,783
Tony here is your quarterback.

728
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:14,501
You protect his blind side. Okay?

729
00:33:14,543 --> 00:33:17,121
When you look at him, you think of me.

730
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:19,540
How you have my back, how you have his.

731
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:20,791
Okay?

732
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,418
Yes, ma'am.

733
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:24,545
Wow.

734
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:27,381
Uh... that...

735
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,758
th-that's really something, Ryan.

736
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,052
I've done "The Blind Side",
"Dances with Wolves",

737
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:35,681
"Terms of Endearment"...
all my mom's favorites.

738
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:37,933
So, are you into any
things that, you know,

739
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:39,059
kids are into?

740
00:33:39,081 --> 00:33:40,081
Yeah.

741
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:42,563
Like, uh, NBA 2K?

742
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:44,314
PewDiePie?

743
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,692
What's that?

744
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:49,778
Or, uh, what about one
of your dad's movies?

745
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,405
You're in a movie?

746
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:54,116
I'm in a bunch of movies, man.

747
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:56,452
Uh, let's see, there's
"Homelander: Origins",

748
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:59,413
uh, "Homelander: Rise of a Hero",
"Homelander: Darkest Day",

749
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:02,332
- "Homelander: Brightest Night"...
- Oh, your dad is so good

750
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,668
- in "Homelander: Brightest Night".
- Thank you.

751
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,545
Mom, can I see them?

752
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:08,589
When you're old enough,
we can talk about it, okay?

753
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,257
Ah, they're PG. He can see them now.

754
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:11,341
You're old enough.

755
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:12,926
You're absolutely old enough.

756
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:15,721
For sleepovers and baseball games

757
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:18,348
- and visits to Vought Land.
- Yeah.

758
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:21,268
Did you know that your dad has

759
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,936
- his own roller coaster?
- Mm-hmm.

760
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,396
Do you want to take a ride

761
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:26,198
- on your dad's roller coaster?
- Can I, Mom?

762
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,202
We can talk about it.

763
00:34:27,244 --> 00:34:28,358
Whenever you want.

764
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:31,903
I need to speak with you.

765
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:33,703
Eh, we're having a
good time here, right?

766
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:34,705
Outside.

767
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,075
Now.

768
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:43,123
That's a great idea.

769
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:46,043
You two... stay here, get
to know each other better.

770
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,252
Okay.

771
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:51,840
I'll show you, um, "Dances with Wolves".

772
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:54,134
- I know what you're doing.
- Nope, you don't.

773
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:56,261
- Yes, I do. I-I can see...
- No, you do not.

774
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:59,765
You could not possibly understand.

775
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:01,767
I was raised the same way as him.

776
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:04,728
That kid doesn't know
anything about anything.

777
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,689
When he sees the outside
world, he's going to panic.

778
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:10,400
Now, that's gonna fuck him up.

779
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:14,238
I do not want my son to have to
go through what I went through.

780
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,367
His life...

781
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:20,410
is different.

782
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,830
He has a mother.

783
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,332
And I know that that means
something to you. I do.

784
00:35:25,374 --> 00:35:27,668
And if you take him
away from me, this...

785
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,336
this whole world will feel so confusing

786
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:31,880
- and frightening.
- Yes, but, Rebecca,

787
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:35,008
you... are lying to him.

788
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,386
Because I love him.

789
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:39,638
And I know a part of you loves him, too,

790
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,431
and that you want what's best for him.

791
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:46,019
But what's best for him is to be
here with me, with his mother.

792
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,313
Look, we have this opportunity

793
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:51,149
to give him a-a childhood you never had.

794
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:53,360
We can do that if he's here with me.

795
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:57,656
Please. I'm begging you, please.

796
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:07,791
Yeah.

797
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,211
I'm sorry.

798
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:13,213
He's very tired.

799
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:14,882
I understand he's had

800
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:16,884
a few surprise visitors today.

801
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:19,970
But you tell him he's got one more.

802
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:22,014
The name's William Butcher.

803
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:35,944
Mr. Butcher, I can't apologize enough

804
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:37,571
for what I've done.

805
00:36:37,613 --> 00:36:39,364
But I can't give you the information...

806
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:45,162
But I can't give you the information

807
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,164
you or Grace came for, either.

808
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:59,468
What was he like?

809
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:00,802
Who?

810
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,554
Homelander.

811
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:05,015
Growing up as a lad, what was he like?

812
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:09,478
I'm sure you don't want
to talk about this...

813
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,981
Oh, there is nothing I
want to talk about more.

814
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:16,568
And who knows better than you?

815
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:21,406
When he was a little boy, five or six,

816
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:23,075
he was quite sweet.

817
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:26,620
He'd cuddle up to me.

818
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:29,873
He loved stories about Davy Crockett,

819
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,833
Teddy Roosevelt.

820
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:35,504
Loved the idea of the woods, the forest,

821
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:38,382
manifest destiny.

822
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:40,342
Well, you know, I needed him to be

823
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:42,803
the strongest man in the world.

824
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:45,597
So I went to work on him.

825
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,599
He didn't even want it.

826
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,062
It was for me.

827
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:57,901
Hmm.

828
00:37:57,943 --> 00:38:00,654
And that wasn't your only sin.

829
00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:04,324
Was it?

830
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:10,372
It wasn't Homelander who hid
my wife away all them years.

831
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:14,084
It ever occur to you...

832
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:18,338
the pain you cause
sorry bastards like me?

833
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:22,509
At the time, it was barely
a blip on my radar.

834
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:29,599
Tell me, Doctor,

835
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:33,020
what's your radar telling you now?

836
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:35,647
Do what you want to me,
but I can't help you.

837
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:37,441
My family would be in...

838
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:40,485
Your family's already in trouble.

839
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:43,530
'Cause I'm about to go
into that room next door

840
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:44,948
to your daughter,

841
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:48,118
and I'm gonna bash her brains out.

842
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,329
And then I'm gonna find your
two sons and their wives

843
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:54,791
and their little kiddies.

844
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:59,421
Your whole fucking family dies today.

845
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:05,218
Or... you help me.

846
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:14,895
What's it gonna be, Doc?

847
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,356
How...?

848
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:19,816
How can...

849
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:22,277
can you be so...?

850
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:27,449
Oh, look at this.

851
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:29,951
Thank you.

852
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:34,372
Do you know...

853
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:36,958
I can't remember the last time

854
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,960
I had a good cup of char.

855
00:39:41,755 --> 00:39:43,799
You're a doll.

856
00:39:57,938 --> 00:40:00,273
You're starting to bleed through.

857
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:02,109
Ah, shit.

858
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,777
This is it, 42D.

859
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:05,112
And she's gonna be there?

860
00:40:29,553 --> 00:40:30,971
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

861
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,570
What the hell? This is
the conference room.

862
00:40:35,571 --> 00:40:36,613
She's not here.

863
00:40:39,813 --> 00:40:41,523
They moved my statue?

864
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,568
What?

865
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,366
I wanted to do it in front of my statue.

866
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:53,368
Do what?

867
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:06,923
I just wanted to make my dad proud.

868
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:14,931
What the fuck?

869
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,725
What the fuck?!

870
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:19,728
Oh, oh, my God. Oh, my God.

871
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:21,104
Oh, my God!

872
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:24,232
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

873
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,531
Please evacuate to the
main floor immediately.

874
00:41:36,745 --> 00:41:40,582
Please evacuate to the
main floor immediately.

875
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:52,770
Mom!

876
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:04,189
Fuck you, man.

877
00:42:07,776 --> 00:42:09,236
Shit, I need his hand.

878
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:15,659
Please evacuate to the
main floor immediately.

879
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:19,120
Huh?

880
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:25,835
Please evacuate to the
main floor immediately.

881
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:34,928
Come on, come on, come on.

882
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:44,437
Please evacuate to the
main floor immediately.

883
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:54,781
Please evacuate to the
main floor immediately.

884
00:44:14,778 --> 00:44:16,613
Was that an Almond Joy?

885
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,157
He has a tree nut allergy.

886
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:37,842
Come with me.

887
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:40,887
...to the main floor immediately.

888
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:49,813
Help! Is anybody there?!

889
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:51,523
Help!

890
00:44:58,321 --> 00:44:59,739
Where's Annie?

891
00:45:01,241 --> 00:45:03,493
Aren't you that sweaty
young man from Believe?

892
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:04,828
Hi, Mrs. January.

893
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:06,830
Is that a human hand?

894
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:10,875
Yes, it is. Come on. We got to go.

895
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:20,051
Hughie?

896
00:45:21,553 --> 00:45:24,639
Annie! Annie! Annie!

897
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:26,474
- Oh, my God! Oh!
- Annie!

898
00:45:27,517 --> 00:45:28,517
Hmm.

899
00:45:28,518 --> 00:45:30,562
Oh!

900
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,982
Hey.

901
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:36,901
Wh-What are you doing here?

902
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:48,913
How are we gonna get out of here?

903
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:51,166
I know a way.

904
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:01,885
All right, dinner's ready!

905
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:07,098
Hey, bud. You ready for dinner?

906
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,728
What's wrong?

907
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,190
You're a liar.

908
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:17,358
- You lied to me.
- What do you mean?

909
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,569
They just flew me up and
showed me! This house is fake?

910
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:21,321
The neighbors are fake? You're fake?

911
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:23,156
Boy deserves to know the truth.

912
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:25,950
Hey. Listen to me.

913
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,243
We can talk about this, okay?

914
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:28,685
I know that you must feel confused,

915
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:30,583
and there are reasons
for what I did. I'm sorry.

916
00:46:30,584 --> 00:46:32,210
No, just don't touch me! I hate you!

917
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:35,919
I think he just needs a little space.

918
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,172
- Come here, son.
- No. No.

919
00:46:39,214 --> 00:46:41,925
All right, he needs his mother.

920
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:43,968
Don't worry. He'll still have a mother.

921
00:46:45,595 --> 00:46:48,014
Hey, Ryan. Ryan!

922
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:49,724
Hey, Ryan, no!

923
00:46:49,766 --> 00:46:51,017
Ryan! No!

924
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:57,941
Oh, my God. No. Please.

925
00:46:57,982 --> 00:47:01,694
Kid, you are fucking unbelievable.

926
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:03,613
All you had to do was watch porn.

927
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:05,495
I didn't know he was
gonna set himself on fire.

928
00:47:05,532 --> 00:47:07,575
- Hey.
- What the fuck are we gonna do now?

929
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:10,161
Butcher? It's me.

930
00:47:10,203 --> 00:47:13,998
No, I'm afraid Hugh let our star
witness burn himself to death.

931
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,459
- Thank you.
- Well, I don't know.

932
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:19,712
What do you mean, no worries?

933
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:22,257
I mean, I've got it sorted.

934
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:40,483
You're gonna stitch me up again?

935
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:42,402
He's at the airport.

936
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:44,070
I promise.

937
00:47:44,112 --> 00:47:46,990
You got a right bloody nerve, you do.

938
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:50,201
Ah, and I didn't mean
for it to go so bad.

939
00:47:50,243 --> 00:47:52,203
I'm sorry.

940
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:54,539
You won't have to see him again.

941
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:57,834
He ain't got much longer.
Couple of months.

942
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:01,838
Tell me when it happens.

943
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,631
I'll piss on his coffin.

944
00:48:03,673 --> 00:48:06,301
I didn't do it for him.

945
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:09,846
He's a cunt.

946
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:17,312
I just thought,

947
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:21,274
when you saw how helpless he is now...

948
00:48:21,316 --> 00:48:22,483
you'd let it go.

949
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:27,030
He wouldn't have this hold over you,

950
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:29,824
and you wouldn't become like...

951
00:48:34,871 --> 00:48:36,539
Yeah, well...

952
00:48:48,593 --> 00:48:50,595
Mm.

953
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:53,681
Mm.

954
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:06,486
I told 'em I wasn't gonna

955
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:08,738
cut my mama out of my life. That's it.

956
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:11,366
And then the Church and their
"Internal Research Bureau"

957
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:13,284
leaked all this [BLEEP] on me.

958
00:49:13,326 --> 00:49:15,119
Eagle contends the Church released

959
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:17,413
a home video where his partner

960
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:20,041
was dressed as a deer

961
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:22,543
that Eagle hunted and mounted.

962
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:23,920
- What?
- Church spokeswoman

963
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,172
Carol Mannheim had this to say.

964
00:49:26,214 --> 00:49:28,049
He has been spreading slanderous

965
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:30,343
and defamatory rumors about our religion

966
00:49:30,385 --> 00:49:32,178
in a desperate attempt to stay relevant.

967
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:35,264
Yeah. Fuck him.

968
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:37,308
Thought he was your friend.

969
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:39,190
Hey, bartender, can we
just change the channel?

970
00:49:39,232 --> 00:49:40,316
The hearing's almost on.

971
00:49:40,358 --> 00:49:41,646
Thanks.

972
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:47,860
Internal investigations,
but we have also hired...

973
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:50,822
Would everybody please take your seats?

974
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:52,657
Starlight?

975
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:54,367
Um, nothing. She's off the grid.

976
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:56,202
- You fucking find her.
- Okay.

977
00:49:58,204 --> 00:50:00,498
This bipartisan committee
is called to order,

978
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,751
investigating Vought International

979
00:50:03,793 --> 00:50:07,130
and its production and
distribution of Compound V,

980
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:09,090
- which I hereby present...
- Okay.

981
00:50:09,132 --> 00:50:11,050
- ...to the committee as evidence.
- This is it.

982
00:50:11,092 --> 00:50:12,969
Mr. Chairman, if I may?

983
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,971
The testimony we're about

984
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:18,015
to hear today will prove
that Vought is guilty

985
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:20,601
of corporate malfeasance
and multiple felonies.

986
00:50:20,643 --> 00:50:22,311
And it'll come from someone

987
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:24,814
that has witnessed
these crimes directly.

988
00:50:24,856 --> 00:50:28,484
The chair calls former CSO of Vought,

989
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,945
Dr. Jonah Vogelbaum.

990
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:37,660
Okay, okay, quiet, everybody.

991
00:50:40,288 --> 00:50:41,873
Quiet.

992
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:52,091
Got you, cunt.

993
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:54,343
Dr. Vogelbaum.

994
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:56,429
Thank you for joining us today.

995
00:50:56,471 --> 00:50:58,181
Raise your right hand.

996
00:50:58,222 --> 00:51:00,641
Do you swear that the testimony
you're about to give today

997
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:03,083
will be the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth?

998
00:51:03,084 --> 00:51:04,520
- I do.
- Thank you.

999
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:06,442
You have five minutes to
make your opening st...

1000
00:51:08,212 --> 00:51:09,212
- Oh!
- Oh, God!

1001
00:51:21,037 --> 00:51:22,997
Do something! What the fuck?!

1002
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:35,134
Oh, shit.

1003
00:52:05,998 --> 00:52:08,292
What the fuck do we do now?

1004
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:29,207
