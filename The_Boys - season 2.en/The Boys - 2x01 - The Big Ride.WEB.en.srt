2
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:19,437
Robin!

3
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:22,022
I heard what happened to
Robin. She wasn't in the street.

4
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:23,607
She was one step off the fucking curb.

5
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:26,068
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- Name's Butcher. Billy Butcher.

6
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,238
Supes lose hundreds of people
each year to collateral damage.

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,532
- That's where I come in.
- To do what?

8
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,875
Frenchie, I need your help, mate.

9
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,319
- Who is he?
- Oh, this here is Hughie Campbell.

10
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:47,940
Hughie? Mother's Milk.

11
00:00:47,982 --> 00:00:50,422
- Who's that?
- She's a Supe Terrorist.

12
00:00:50,423 --> 00:00:51,550
Her name's Kimiko.

13
00:00:51,591 --> 00:00:53,012
Bonjour, Kimiko.

14
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:56,891
I have always wanted to be in the Seven.

15
00:00:56,932 --> 00:01:00,352
Please welcome Starlight.

16
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,754
It's just a question of how bad
you want to be in the Seven.

17
00:01:02,755 --> 00:01:05,107
We are going to be stationing you

18
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:07,443
in Sandusky, Ohio for a while.

19
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:12,198
- I'm Hughie, by the way.
- Annie. Would you like my number?

20
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,410
Hughie.

21
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:18,245
Looks like you've got your tongue

22
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:20,080
halfway down the opposition's throat.

23
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:22,124
- She's not a bad person.
- She's a Supe.

24
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,210
Hugh Campbell killed Translucent.

25
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,754
- What if he was helped?
- Whoa, whoa. Hold on.

26
00:01:26,796 --> 00:01:28,379
Keep those hands down by your sides.

27
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,174
You have to explain, Hughie.

28
00:01:30,216 --> 00:01:32,134
You were the only thing
that I could count on.

29
00:01:32,136 --> 00:01:33,456
This is about Compound V.

30
00:01:33,457 --> 00:01:34,845
It gives the Supes their powers.

31
00:01:34,847 --> 00:01:36,367
What are you talking about?

32
00:01:36,368 --> 00:01:37,452
We're born like this.

33
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,726
That was diabolical.

34
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:45,356
No one's putting Supes
into national defense.

35
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:47,399
You stay the fuck back
or I'll laser you!

36
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,194
If they let us into the military,

37
00:01:50,236 --> 00:01:52,363
this will never happen again.

38
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:54,244
I know what it's like to lose someone.

39
00:01:54,245 --> 00:01:56,075
Homelander raped my wife Becca.

40
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,536
You and me, we're in this together.

41
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,647
We have to go back for them.
This is never gonna stop...

42
00:02:09,648 --> 00:02:12,216
- it's just gonna be more blood...
- If you don't like to play,

43
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:13,634
why did you join the fucking team?

44
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,763
You came here?

45
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,473
- Without Butcher?
- Yeah.

46
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,311
I'm out.

47
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,108
You came.

48
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,194
I'm a fucking superhero.

49
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,916
I think he's having a heart attack.

50
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:40,035
No more lies. You fucking promised me.

51
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,709
Hey, pal.

52
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,669
I'm your father.

53
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:51,589
Becca?

54
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:19,074
Baby kale salad?

55
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,953
I'm on page 134.

56
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:26,081
Chain of command doesn't apply
to other military contractors

57
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,184
in the field; I don't see
why it should apply to us.

58
00:03:28,226 --> 00:03:29,585
Caprese sandwich?

59
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:31,128
Well, when they're in actual combat,

60
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,714
whom exactly do your heroes report to?

61
00:03:33,756 --> 00:03:37,968

Yankee White designation for Compound V.

69

they have Compound V in their veins.

81
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:38,070

Today I can report to
the American people

113
00:06:12,662 --> 00:06:14,875
that Black Noir has
conducted an operation

114
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:17,795
killing the Super
Terrorist known as Naqib.

115
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:26,762
But that doesn't mean
sacrifices won't still be made.

116
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:31,558
The proof of that, sadly...

117
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,268
lies before us.

118
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:39,274
For today, we mourn a
fallen member of the Seven.

119
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,276
Translucent.

120
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,779
Murdered in cold blood

121
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:47,157
by the cartel Super Terrorist El Diablo.

122
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:52,412
Before he left,

123
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:56,416
Translucent said to me...

124
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,503
Almost as if he knew
something was gonna happen,

125
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:00,754
he said...

126
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:04,007
"Hey, Homelander.

127
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,569
Tell my son Maverick that I love him".

128
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,681
And he also said,

129
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,016
"You find those Super Terrorists..."

130
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:17,813
Well, Super Villains is really
the only term, but he said,

131
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,482
"You find them, Homelander.

132
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,693
And you stop them".

133
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,946
So I say to you, Maverick...

134
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,739
and to all the sons and daughters

135
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:31,451
of this great nation, I will stop them.

136
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,789
I will save you.

137
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,171
I'll do it for you.

138
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:45,716
For America.

139
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,226
And for a dear...

140
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:58,270
dear old friend.

141
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,693

142
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:09,907

What?

can't just cut me from

00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,188
Okay. That's enough.

167
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,482
Time to go.

168
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:27,651
Just get me another
fucking lava flow, please.

169
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:30,362
I said it's time to go, or I call TMZ.

I miss him, too, pal.

00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,857

It means a lot.

- Hi, David. - David.

187
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,586
How's everyone holding up in the Tower?

188
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,589
Well... I'm not gonna lie, um,

189
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,007
- it's hard.
- Mm-hmm.

190
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:34,676
It's really hard. Um...

191
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,887
It comes in waves, you know?

192
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:40,766
Yeah, but this one, he's
just really been our rock.

193
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,226
He sat us down and he said,

194
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,270
"We're more than just
a team. We're a family.

And we need to pull together like one".

- Aw, thank you.

we would be without you.

- Yes. Uh, yes.

00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,934
I snapped the SIM card, okay?

249
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,103
And no one followed me down here,

250
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:57,397
and they can't even

00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:13,163
You look very, you know, uh...

255
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,708
Yeah, I'm lying. I'm sorry.

256
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,002
- You look like shit.
- I know.

257
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:21,254
I know.

258
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:22,672

259
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,509

264
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:51,660
Oh, shit.

265
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:56,414
I know him.

266
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,416
- You do?
- Yeah.

267
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,669
I mean, not for a while,

268
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,421
but yes, from my Capes for Christ days.

269
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,634
Are you sure you can do this?

270
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,636
I have a choice?

271
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,813
Hey, I, uh...

272
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,856
I saw a really great picture of you

273
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,442
at the Teen Choice Awards
with, um... what's his name?

274
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,237
Ansel Adams?

275
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,199

276
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:33,493
Are you stalking me on Instagram?

277
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,745
No. No, of course not.
Get over yourself.

278
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:38,331
So did the PR people put you
together or what, what's...

279
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:40,583
- No. He's a nice guy.
- He's an actor.

280
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:45,046
He's an actor who didn't
lie to my face every day.

281
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,801
Okay, yeah. Yeah, I got it. Ouch.

282
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,556
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

283
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,683

284

Hey.

287
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,444
Get some sleep.

288
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,781
I'll sleep when I know you're safe.

289
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,128
You think this is fun?

290
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,714
You think water's supposed to be fun?

291
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:30,300
Try swimming in the Mariana Trench,

292
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:31,843
you little fucking idiots.

293
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,345
Yeah, not so fun there.

294
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,640
No, it's dark and it's cold.

295
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:40,268
- And you're so alone.
- Sir?

296
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,188
- You're so...
- Sir?

297
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,315
...goddamn fucking alone.

298
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,910
Swim free, little fish.

299
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,203
You made bail.

300
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:11,508
Hey, man.

301
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:12,967
Want a Fresca?

302
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:16,763
Thanks.

303
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:18,348
Hey, I know you.

304
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:21,893
Yeah, you're, uh, Raven... Ravenwing.

305
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:25,688
It's Eagle. Eagle the
Archer. Out of Cleveland?

306
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,690
We met, like, five times at Vought-Con.

307
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:30,902
I mean... mm. No, that doesn't matter.

308
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,779
You bailed me out?

309
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:35,240
- Yeah.
- Why?

310
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,867
Because even heroes need
a hand once in a while.

311
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,118
Come on.

312
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,832
The Translucent franchise,

313
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,960
especially Invisible Force 2, is...

314
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,462
Please.

315
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:51,881
My baby needs a mother.

316
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:55,969
Oi! Shut your trap, you dumb bird,

317
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:59,472
or else I'll bollocks you.

318
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:02,809
But that's exactly what
William Butcher did.

319
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:06,104
He murdered Vought Vice
President Madelyn Stillwell

320
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,858
using upwards of 30 pounds of C-4.

321
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,568
Why would William Butcher do it?

322
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:14,946
Disgruntled, perhaps,
over his deceased wife,

323
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,489
a former Vought employee.

324
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:21,411
And why was Madelyn Stillwell's
baby found safe in a yard

325
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,204
17 miles away?

326
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:25,623
It is a puzzle.

327
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,126
Where is Monsieur Charcuter?

328
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,588
- Why hasn't he called?
- Who cares?

329
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:32,881
He could be dead.

330
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,173
No. No.

331
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,675
He's too much of an asshole to die.

332
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:38,219
...or any of his known associates...

333
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:41,306
Marvin Milk, Hugh Campbell, or this man,

334
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,266
whose real identity is unknown...

335
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:47,854
please call 1-888-0-CRIMES.

336
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,314
Christ.

337
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,736
We gotta get out of here, now.

338
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:57,405
Good passports do not come cheap.

339
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,616
I sell the RPGs, smuggle
in the Kalashnikovs.

340
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,784
We have enough money. That's it.

341
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,611
- Where will you go, Petit Hughie?
- Could just stay here.

342
00:20:07,612 --> 00:20:09,417
With Frenchie's gangbanger friends.

343
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,544
The cots, they got 31
flavors of semen on them.

344
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:12,629
You'll love 'em.

345
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,506
Oh, and you have a better idea?

346
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,634
No, maybe we can stay, all of us,

347
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:18,801
in your mother's asshole.

348
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:22,472
Or... maybe we could not run.

349
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,933
You are like a record that is broken.

350
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,352
Well, we shouldn't just give up.

351
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,270
Guys, we get some Compound V,

352
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:30,980
we-we bring it to The New York Times,

353
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,315
we burn Vought to the ground.

354
00:20:32,317 --> 00:20:33,837
You got some V, Hughie?

355
00:20:33,838 --> 00:20:36,235
- 'Cause I don't.
- We could...

356
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:39,197
get some. Someone could help us get it.

357
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,240
And who might that be?

358
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:44,924
You did not hear the television?

359
00:20:44,925 --> 00:20:46,746
We are famous now.

360
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,308
- Butcher even more so.
- Fuck Butcher!

361
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:49,499
We don't need him.

362
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,000
A-Team had Hannibal.

363
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:53,002
Dirty Dozen, Lee Marvin.

364
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,879
Beatles, Brian Epstein.

365
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,381
We don't need Butcher.

366
00:20:56,422 --> 00:21:00,718
Okay, who's going to
be our captain? You?

367
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,680
I mean, guys,
just-just-just hear me out.

368
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:07,016
Shut the fuck up!

369
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:12,647
This is over.

370
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:01,923
Homelander, hi.

371
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,466
Ashley.

372
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:08,471
Glad to see you're, uh,
making yourself at home.

373
00:23:08,513 --> 00:23:11,307
Yeah.

374
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:13,392
Renovation is definitely overdue.

375
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:16,062
It's like 2003 called, they
want their office back.

376
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:17,271
You know?

377
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,565
Huh. I liked it.

378
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,776
Yeah, me, too. It was really great.

379
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:24,654
Homelander, I just want
to thank you again

380
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,823
for recommending me for this job.

381
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:31,744
I was so surprised to get the call.

382
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:34,956
I am gonna fill Ms. Stillwell's shoes

383
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,791
as best I can.

384
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,628
God rest her soul.

385
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:41,754
Yeah.

386
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:44,966
God rest it. Yeah.

387
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:50,096
Any luck catching her
killer, that Butcher maniac?

388
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:55,268
No, not yet.

389
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:58,312
But we will.

390
00:23:58,354 --> 00:23:59,856
Oh, good news.

391
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:01,482
I think I found a hero.

392
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:05,236
Perfect candidate to
replace Translucent.

393
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,363
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

394
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:08,823
So soon?

395
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:10,158
He's in the gym right now.

396
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,284
You want to meet him?

397
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:13,286
Do I?

398
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:15,204
Lead the way.

399
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:28,009
That's Blindspot, right?

400
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,761
A differently abled member of the Seven.

401
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:35,308
We're gonna poll through
the roof with millennials.

402
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:37,911
Inclusion's a big priority
to them right now.

403
00:24:37,952 --> 00:24:39,936
- Amazing.
- And then I think we find

404
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:41,731
an ethnic or female or, fingers crossed,

405
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:43,608
an ethnic female to replace the Deep,

406
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:44,859
and we're golden.

407
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:53,910
Homelander, wow, you're...

408
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,870
It's-it's an honor, sir.

409
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:58,206
Wait. Hold on.

410
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,499
- You can tell it's me?
- Mm-hmm.

411
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,585
Wow.

412
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:05,171
That's-that's impressive.

413
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:07,381
You don't need super eyes
when you have super ears.

414
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:10,635
Can I just say, that is amazing.

415
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:13,763
And you, my friend, are a true hero.

416
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:15,640
Not because of what you do for a job,

417
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,850
but...

418
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:19,412
well, because of what you've overcome.

419
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:20,978
Thank you.

420
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,314
That means everything coming from you.

421
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:25,691
Aw, stop it. Come on.

422
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:28,027
Hey, guys, um,

423
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:29,079
I just have one question,

424
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,863
- if that's okay.
- Yeah.

425
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:32,531
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

426
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:36,410
All right, so...

427
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,412
what happens if, uh,

428
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,289
I don't know, I do this?

429
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:50,216
And now you're just another
useless fuckin' blind guy.

430
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:55,596
This must be some kind of a joke.

431
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:57,348
Ashley...

432
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:01,686
What made you think I would ever
allow a cripple into the Seven?

433
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:04,814
For fuck sakes, Ashley, don't
look at him, look at me!

434
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:09,568
Ashley! Look at me.

435
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,989
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Let's get one thing straight.

436
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:16,075
The only reason you're here
and not doing corporate PR

437
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:17,994
for fucking Diva Cups

438
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,787
is that I brought you here.

439
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:22,957
You are dispensable, which
means you answer to me.

440
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:24,375
Okay. Okay.

441
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:29,463
From now on, I will set my own agenda,

442
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:30,881
I'll approve my own marketing

443
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,925
and write my own talking points.

444
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:36,012
You will tell me everything that goes on

445
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:39,098
on the 99th floor, and
I mean everything.

446
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,850
Every call, e-mail, group chat.

447
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:44,562
If a fucking light bulb
goes out, you will tell me.

448
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:49,483
And, Ashley, in no fucking way

449
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:53,612
do you decide who goes in the Seven.

450
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:56,824
I decide.

451
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:59,493
Do we have an understanding?

452
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,245
Yes.

453
00:27:05,283 --> 00:27:08,243
Translucent was laid to rest today,

454
00:27:08,244 --> 00:27:10,254
surrounded by his family, friends, fans

455
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:11,464
and fellow Vought comrades.

456
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:12,923
You can see the memorial

457
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,717
featuring a performance by Starlight

458
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:17,428
singing "Never Truly
Vanish" on Voughtify.

459
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,930
Available now.

460
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:21,849
♪ Your spirit ♪

461
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:25,770
♪ Fills the sky... ♪

462
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,813
Bet you can't resist this arrest.

463
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:30,232
America's hottest crime-fighter
is giving law enforcement

464
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:33,402
a superpowered makeover
in Citizen Starlight.

465
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:35,112
Coming this fall from Vought.

466
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:38,199
Go ahead, make her day.

467
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:20,116
You know how it is.

468
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:23,953
Don't want to get stuck
with the cleaning bill.

469
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:30,709
Okay.

470
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:32,545
So, what's your poison?

471
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,213
You a leg guy?

472
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:38,968
Uh, d... a-an arm, please, actually.

473
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,678
400?

474
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:05,035
Um, d-do you want me to, uh,

475
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:08,581
- s-saw or-or chop or...?
- Whatever floats your boat, tiger.

476
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,558
Holy shit.

477
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:35,900
Holy shit! Holy shit!

478
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:38,277
Thank you. That was so...

479
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:40,738
I-I can keep the arm, right?

480
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,782
Yeah, just keep it refrigerated.

481
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:52,166
For an extra grand, I'll
let you chop off my dick.

482
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,130
Where's the closest ATM?

483
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:23,072
- What the hell happened?
- Aide!

484
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:24,698
Holy shit. Sit him down.

485
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,035
- Sit him down.
- Just bring him over here.

486
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:30,871
Aide le!

487
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:32,706
- Aide le!
- What's wrong?

488
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:38,879
Shit.

489
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:41,632
Listen, he's broken every
single bone in his arm.

490
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,509
Broken half his ribs. I
can't do nothing here.

491
00:30:43,528 --> 00:30:44,968
You got to take him to the hospital.

492
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:46,262
Hospital...

493
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:47,555
Translate for me, Frenchie.

494
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:49,076
Tell him to take him to the hospital.

495
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,603
Fuck!

496
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,316
Move, move.

497
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:13,706
Okay?!

498
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,928
What'd he say? What's going on?

499
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:33,142
Frenchie, what did he say?

500
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,923
- Cops seen this?
- No one's seen it.

501
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,592
I ain't trying to get
life without parole.

502
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:54,139
They promised me.

503
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:57,768
They would only smuggle in
guns and cocaine and fentanyl.

504
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,812
- Not fucking...
- Not human fucking cargo?

505
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:02,606
- Jesus Christ, Frenchie.
- They didn't tell me.

506
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:05,609
Or you didn't ask.

507
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:27,756
A Supe.

508
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:29,133
Supe Terrorist.

509
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:36,849
They got paid to smuggle
in a Supe Terrorist.

510
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:44,231
How about this one?

511
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:46,900
How does it make you feel? Anyone?

512
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:49,528
- I hate it.
- That's a strong reaction, Margaret.

513
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,155
I'd love to follow up on that.

514
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:52,716
What do you mean when you say you hate

515
00:33:52,717 --> 00:33:54,116
the term "Super Terrorist"?

516
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:56,076
I just mean, it's really scary.

517
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:57,494
It makes me want to lock the door

518
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,037
and hide under the bed, you know?

519
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,539
Which means a double-digit drop

520
00:34:00,581 --> 00:34:02,301
the opening weekend of
the Tek-Knight movie.

521
00:34:02,302 --> 00:34:03,834
I keep saying

522
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:06,503
"Super Villain" is the better term.

523
00:34:06,505 --> 00:34:09,145
Uh, "Super Criminals" sounds
like something in a cartoon.

524
00:34:09,146 --> 00:34:11,842
Jill, ask them what they
think about "Super Villain".

525
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:14,344
Uh, what about the term "Super Villain"?

526
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:17,514
That sounds better to me. More exciting.

527
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:20,392
- More exotic.
- Okay.

528
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:25,564
Okay, turning our
attention back to these,

529
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:27,608
which do you prefer?

530
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,652
"Saving America", can
I get a show of hands?

531
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:34,281
Okay. How about "Saving the World"? Wow.

532
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:36,950
Unanimous, strong reaction.
So what is it about...

533
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:40,078
Nope. It's "Saving America".

534
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,706
Uh...

535
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:46,001
I-I don't know. I-I feel like
"Saving the World" has a...

536
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:49,338
Okay. But is there something specific

537
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,548
about "Saving the World"
that "Saving America..."

538
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,259
It's Americans that are
gonna keep us in the Army,

539
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:56,512
not the fucking world.

540
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:58,514
It's "Saving America".

541
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:00,933
Mm-hmm?

542
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:02,893
Pull the trigger.

543
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:05,187
Great. Great.

544
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,453
Hey, man.

545
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:26,208
Thanks for letting me crash.

546
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,710
Sorry, about the bathroom.

547
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:32,172
- I'll clean it up.
- No need to apologize.

548
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,345
Okay.

549
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:39,805
Oh, shit.

550
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:41,727
- You scared me.
- Oh, that's just Carol.

551
00:35:41,728 --> 00:35:43,600
Good friend.

552
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:47,604
Carol, this is the Deep.

553
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:50,274
I have been looking forward
to meeting you, Deep.

554
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,526
Would you like a Fresca?

555
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:55,988
Thank you.

556
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:01,118
Anyway, no need to apologize.

557
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,453
We've all been there. It's tough.

558
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,375
- Been where?
- Rock bottom.

559
00:36:09,418 --> 00:36:10,752
I...

560
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,838
I don't think I'm at rock bottom.

561
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,382
Uh, f-for me,

562
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:20,220
my aha moment came with a
hostage situation at Kroger.

563
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:22,264
Multiple shooters.

564
00:36:22,306 --> 00:36:27,769
I showed up, I'm letting
arrows fly, my aim is perfect.

565
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:29,813
But...

566
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:37,029
...there's only so many
arrows a quiver can hold.

567
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,865
I just ran out.

568
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:45,329
And then, we lost a lot
of good people that day.

569
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,457
Then you start to question,

570
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:52,711
like, fucking arrows against TEC-9s?

571
00:36:52,753 --> 00:36:56,548
- But?
- But I came to see

572
00:36:56,590 --> 00:37:00,802
that archery isn't
irrelevant, it's timeless.

573
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:05,432
It's a pure and ancient art.

574
00:37:05,474 --> 00:37:07,643
Carol helped me see that.

575
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:09,645
And what are you, his therapist

576
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:12,356
- or something?
- No.

577
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:16,193
No, therapy's very
destructive, actually.

578
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,362
You could say I'm his teacher.

579
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:21,156
What about you, Deep?

580
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:23,492
What-what about, what about me?

581
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,285
How did you end up here?

582
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,747
You can tell her, Deep.

583
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,918
Tell her what?

584
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,544
About your drinking.

585
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,755
About your self-esteem issues.

586
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:39,174
- Really open up, Deep.
- No, I don't...

587
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:40,856
I don't have a drinking...

588
00:37:40,857 --> 00:37:42,761
- I'm fine.
- This is a safe space, Deep.

589
00:37:42,803 --> 00:37:45,722
If you don't have any
self-esteem issues,

590
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,933
why are you constantly demeaning women?

591
00:37:47,975 --> 00:37:50,352
- That's a good question, Deep.
- Okay, thank you.

592
00:37:50,394 --> 00:37:52,354
You know what? I don't
know what the fuck this is,

593
00:37:52,355 --> 00:37:54,272
but it's weird as fuck, so I'm leaving.

594
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:56,108
W-We just want to help.

595
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:58,902
- Carol really helped me, Deep.
- No, thank you.

596
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:01,571
Help you get back into the Seven.

597
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:21,800
Yesterday, the Deep was found
drunkenly ranting at children

598
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:24,803
at Splash Zone in Sandusky, Ohio.

599
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:27,431
He was later arrested
and taken to Sandusky...

600
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:33,353
...he was released
on bail shortly after.

601
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:34,813
Did you make this?

602
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:47,993
You wrote something.

603
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,372
"Boy".

604
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:54,207
What boy?

605
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:57,210
I do not understand. What boy?

606
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:08,263
Okay, so?

607
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:10,891
They were wired the money
from a blind account

608
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:12,768
to smuggle the bastard in.

609
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,269
Cold trail.

610
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:15,937
Amazing fucking friends of yours.

611
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:18,231
I never said they were my friends, huh?

612
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:20,317
I only said we will be...

613
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,028
safe here.

614
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,654
Okay, okay, all right. What do we do?

615
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:27,282
Oh, you just call 911.

616
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:28,992
What, an anonymous tip?

617
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:30,914
Yeah, I'm sure that'll go
straight to the mayor.

618
00:39:30,915 --> 00:39:32,496
You saw that video.

619
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:34,097
What if he does that to-to an airplane?

620
00:39:34,098 --> 00:39:35,499
Or the fucking Brooklyn Bridge?

621
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,418
So, what's your big plan, Hughie?

622
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,254
Okay, the CIA lady, right?

623
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:42,589
Rayner.

624
00:39:42,631 --> 00:39:45,342
Right, the same CIA

625
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,511
that wants to clamp our nuts

626
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,096
into some jumper cables.

627
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:51,098
We could call Butcher.

628
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,974
For the last time, we
don't need Butcher.

629
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:54,851
Then what?

630
00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:58,980
We should...

631
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:01,024
call Annie.

632
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:05,487
"Call Annie".

633
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:09,825
Annie?

634
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:12,577
Yeah.

635
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,580
You mean Starlight?

636
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,085
'Cause that's who she is.

637
00:40:20,127 --> 00:40:24,297
Vought has her phone so bugged...

638
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:26,675
they're praying that you do that.

639
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:32,389
Oh, no.

640
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,974
You fucking called her?

641
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:36,810
No, no. I'm not, I'm not stupid, okay?

642
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:41,481
- I texted her.
- Oh, fuck.

643
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:43,859
And then we met up, but we're
getting some Compound V.

644
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,103
- Fuck you, Hughie! Are you fucking crazy?
- Hey, man!

645
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:47,903
- Are you fucking crazy?!
- We were careful!

646
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:49,071
- What the fuck are you doing?!
- We used burner...

647
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:51,158
- We used burner phones.
- Kid, you don't get it!

648
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,659
They could've been following you.

649
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:55,745
They could be watching
us right fucking now!

650
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,708
If you're the fucking reason

651
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,501
why I can't finish

652
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:03,336
that Vermont country dollhouse,

653
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:04,880
I will fucking end you.

654
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:06,339
You've been walking around for days

655
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:08,008
like you want to kick my ass,

656
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:10,260
so do it already.

657
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:17,058
Goddamn it.

658
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:20,979
Shit!

659
00:41:24,024 --> 00:41:26,902
I don't want to kick your ass, Hughie.

660
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:30,530
I just don't want to get dragged
back into this shit, all right?

661
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:33,325
I want to get home to my wife

662
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:35,160
and my kid.

663
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:37,245
That's it.

664
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:40,707
If I still can.

665
00:41:40,749 --> 00:41:42,375
This guy could kill a lot of people.

666
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:45,337
Hughie... let somebody
else handle it, okay?

667
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:46,463
There's no one else!

668
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,797
No one's coming to save us.

669
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,090
You don't get it.

670
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:51,343
You are not a soldier.

671
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:54,137
You're not a spy.

672
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:56,723
You're just a kid that
sells stereo equipment.

673
00:41:56,765 --> 00:41:58,016
No, I don't!

674
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:01,228
I don't have a job.

675
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:06,149
Or Robin.

676
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:07,776
Or my dad.

677
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:10,654
Or Annie.

678
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:13,240
One way or another, they all, uh...

679
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,663
Now all I have is this.

680
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:21,748
This.

681
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:24,251
Which is really fucking
depressing, but it's true.

682
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:30,382
So, maybe I can't be Lee Marvin.

683
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:33,134
But I can be Harry Potter.

684
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:36,638
Or, uh... you know, John Connor

685
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,766
or-or-or what's her name
from "The Hunger Games".

686
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:40,892
Katniss.

687
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:44,729
Yeah, the point is I could be the person

688
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:46,731
that nobody thinks is awesome,

689
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:49,776
but it turns out they're
kind of fucking awesome.

690
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,738
M.M.

691
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,198
Listen, we help the CIA lady,

692
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,034
she could help you maybe
get back to your family.

693
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:00,578
Did you ever think of that?

694
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:06,876
My baby needs a mother!

695
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:10,463
Oi! Shut your trap, you dumb bird...

696
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:13,758
or else I'll bollocks you.

697
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,887
But that's exactly what
William Butcher did.

698
00:43:20,724 --> 00:43:21,891
Gecko?

699
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:23,685
Is that you?

700
00:43:23,727 --> 00:43:25,145
Starlight?

701
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:27,439
I mean, Annie, hi.

702
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,482
- Hi.
- Oh, my God, hi!

703
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,528
Look at you, big-time Seven hero.

704
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:34,738
Oh, shut up.

705
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:36,323
You know, I-I work in Vought Tower

706
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,908
at the, uh, labs on-on 67?

707
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,577
Oh, you don't say?

708
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:41,995
I see your posters everywhere.

709
00:43:42,037 --> 00:43:43,580
They're marketing the shit out of you.

710
00:43:44,873 --> 00:43:48,001
I'm happy for you, really.

711
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:50,420
Buy you some coffee?

712
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:52,672
Thank you.

713
00:43:52,714 --> 00:43:55,216
Yeah, at the, uh, Capes for
Christ Bible Camp, yes, totally.

714
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:57,052
Mm-hmm, that Passion play we put on?

715
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:58,478
You were the best Jesus.

716
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,679
I mean, no one's gonna take

717
00:43:59,696 --> 00:44:01,096
a nail through the hand like I can.

718
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:03,475
And Big Game was Pontius Pilate.

719
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:06,311
Oh, my God, those freckles.

720
00:44:06,353 --> 00:44:07,937
You know he wanted to make out with me?

721
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:09,898
- Pontius Pilate and Mary hooking up?
- Mm-hmm.

722
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:10,940
Ooh, "sacri-licious".

723
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,192
Yeah, we never did.

724
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:13,610
Why not?

725
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,612
- He was so cute.
- Yeah, it just,

726
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,113
it was what Ezekiel always said.

727
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,448
And my mom, too.

728
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:20,033
That God is watching over you,

729
00:44:20,075 --> 00:44:22,077
every second.

730
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:24,079
You know, I thought
that He was watching us,

731
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,539
and I thought that He'd be upset.

732
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,166
Yeah, it's a, it's a messed up thing

733
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:29,667
- to tell a kid.
- Yeah.

734
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:31,836
But looking back?

735
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:34,506
I should've made out with Big Game.

736
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:36,966
I should've done a lot more stuff.

737
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:38,510
Because...

738
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:40,929
there is nothing

739
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:42,931
up there.

740
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:46,559
There's nobody in the
sky watching over us.

741
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:51,231
Not God, not Homelander.

742
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,442
Not anybody.

743
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,696
It's all just...

744
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:00,865
lies.

745
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:13,044
I need a favor.

746
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:14,504
Yeah.

747
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:17,173
Yeah, anything for a Bible Camp alum.

748
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:25,515
I need you to go into the labs on 67,

749
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:28,226
and steal me a sample of Compound V.

750
00:45:31,271 --> 00:45:33,356
Um...

751
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:35,024
I, uh...

752
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,609
I don't, I don't know what that is.

753
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:38,319
Ah, see?

754
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:42,073
Another lie.

755
00:45:42,115 --> 00:45:44,284
I know how we're made.

756
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:46,744
And it is not Jesus.

757
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:49,956
I can't.

758
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:51,040
I mean, it's impossible.

759
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:52,125
I'm a nobody there.

760
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:53,585
I'm a lab rat.

761
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:55,226
They cut off my limbs
and they grow back.

762
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:57,255
- I can't get you...
- You have to.

763
00:45:57,297 --> 00:46:00,008
Or I put this on Facebook tonight.

764
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,597
Gecko,

765
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:07,432
former teen star

766
00:46:07,474 --> 00:46:10,101
of Vought Summertime Clubhouse,

767
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:13,438
working as an S&M hooker

768
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,732
as a side hustle?

769
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:21,446
I'm sure inquiring minds
will want to know.

770
00:46:21,488 --> 00:46:24,199
Annie?

771
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,658
I thought that we were friends?

772
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,203
I'm sorry.

773
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:29,787
But...

774
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:31,873
we're not anything.

775
00:46:41,925 --> 00:46:43,092
Hi.

776
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:44,677
You know who we are.

777
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,888
But let's meet another hero.

778
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:50,016
This is Lance Corporal Dan Miller.

779
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:52,477
Dan and the other brave
Marines of Second Battalion

780
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:56,022
are helping keep you safe
from the Super Villain threat.

781
00:46:56,064 --> 00:46:57,732
We're proud to fly alongside them.

782
00:46:57,774 --> 00:47:00,443
And now, we could use your support.

783
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:03,446
That's right, Maeve, with our
new campaign, Saving America.

784
00:47:03,488 --> 00:47:05,907
Here I go, you guys! Wish me luck.

785
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:08,660
Oh, FYI, not a real base.

786
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:11,746
As if Homelander and
Maeve are gonna eat MREs

787
00:47:11,788 --> 00:47:13,748
and piss in a ditch with
the rest of the grunts.

788
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:15,910
Uh, hey, yeah, hi, we're
filming right now. Excuse me?

789
00:47:15,911 --> 00:47:19,295
Also, you might recognize
"Army Boy" as Hotel Clerk #2

790
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:21,377
- from "The Devil's Breath"
- Hello, excuse... okay.

791
00:47:21,378 --> 00:47:23,174
episode of "Criminal
Minds: Beyond Borders".

792
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:24,592
Well, hello!

793
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:26,636
Oh, my God, hi!

794
00:47:26,678 --> 00:47:28,137
My nana's your biggest fan.

795
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:29,264
I'm Stormfront.

796
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:30,723
- Great.
- Oh, right, yeah.

797
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:32,559
From Seattle, right?

798
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:38,773
Uh... Portland, actually,
Your, uh, Highness.

799
00:47:38,815 --> 00:47:41,067
Holy shit!

800
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:43,111
Your eyes are really
fucking blue up close.

801
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:46,573
You are... fun.

802
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:48,491
It's been a hoot, but we got work to do,

803
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:50,243
so... let's get back to it.

804
00:47:50,285 --> 00:47:52,370
Oh, totally, uh,

805
00:47:52,412 --> 00:47:54,455
they just wanted me to meet you.

806
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:55,748
Who?

807
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:58,209
Oh, the boys on 82.

808
00:47:58,251 --> 00:48:00,503
- I'm the new girl.
- Wait...

809
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:02,839
what are you talking about?

810
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,340
Oh! Hi.

811
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:06,092
I'm in the Seven.

812
00:48:06,134 --> 00:48:08,595
Replacing Translucent.

813
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:10,847
God bless his soul.

814
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:13,057
Ink's barely dry, but, uh,

815
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:14,809
yeah, reporting for duty,

816
00:48:14,851 --> 00:48:17,270
so... fuck yeah!

817
00:48:17,312 --> 00:48:19,397
Um, no, I don't think
that this is, it's not true.

818
00:48:19,439 --> 00:48:21,899
I don't know anything about this.

819
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:23,276
Wow!

820
00:48:23,318 --> 00:48:27,322
Well, uh, Stormfront?

821
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:29,741
Who delivered the good news?

822
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:33,161
Oh, uh, Mr. Edgar,

823
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:35,496
the big guy?

824
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:38,124
- All right, back to one.
- Wonderful.

825
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:40,126
Great.

826
00:48:40,168 --> 00:48:42,879
All right!

827
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,466
- Great!
- We're going again, people.

828
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:49,677
Well, I think this is going great.

829
00:48:53,306 --> 00:48:54,891
You know,

830
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,809
you ain't John Cusack, man.

831
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:59,937
You ain't got no motherfucking boom box.

832
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:01,939
- Sorry?
- You want to get back together

833
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:03,650
- with Starlight.
- No. No-no, I don't.

834
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:05,151
Yes. Yes, you do.

835
00:49:05,193 --> 00:49:07,737
But this ain't the way to do it, Hughie.

836
00:49:07,779 --> 00:49:09,530
You can't keep pulling this shit, man.

837
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:11,783
Calling her, texting her.

838
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:13,576
Are you crazy?

839
00:49:13,578 --> 00:49:14,898
You know, you sound like Butcher.

840
00:49:14,899 --> 00:49:16,537
- She's on our side.
- I know.

841
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:18,081
I'm saying this for her, kid.

842
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:19,957
You're putting her in danger.

843
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:22,585
Homelander finds out that
she's been talking to you?

844
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:25,046
She's fucked.

845
00:49:25,088 --> 00:49:27,423
The deeper you keep
pushing her into this thing,

846
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:29,926
the deeper in the meat grinder she goes.

847
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,348
How are you guys doing?

848
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:37,308
We're hanging in there.

849
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:38,893
Has Butcher contacted you?

850
00:49:38,935 --> 00:49:40,061
Nope.

851
00:49:40,103 --> 00:49:42,605
He's completely ghosted.

852
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:45,650
Do you think he killed
Madelyn Stillwell?

853
00:49:45,652 --> 00:49:47,532
I'd like to think that he didn't.

854
00:49:47,533 --> 00:49:50,703
But I... I don't know.

855
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:54,742
Deputy Director, I
know this might not be

856
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:56,953
the best time to ask,
but do you ever...?

857
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,621
Hear about your family?

858
00:49:58,663 --> 00:50:02,458
Your daughter is, uh,
starting soccer, I think.

859
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:07,338
Soccer?

860
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,841
Um, ma'am.

861
00:50:09,882 --> 00:50:11,592
Can M.M. see them?

862
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:15,138
You know what, let's, let's
see if this checks out.

863
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:18,057
And I will see what I can do.

864
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:22,186
Thank you, ma'am.

865
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:23,988
Okay, so give me the
description of this guy.

866
00:50:23,989 --> 00:50:27,442
All right, uh, about five-ten, 165,

867
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:30,445
black hair, wearing knockoff
jeans and sneakers

868
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:34,031
probably from Taiwan, maybe India.

869
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:36,659
You got all that from the video?

870
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:38,619
So, the other shoe drops,

871
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:40,455
and it just crushes us all.

872
00:50:40,496 --> 00:50:42,540
Meaning?

873
00:50:42,582 --> 00:50:46,169
Meaning I've been trying
to put this puzzle together,

874
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,504
and there's a missing piece
and it's been driving me nuts.

875
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:50,506
And I think you just handed it to me.

876
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:52,148
Okay, so, then, what's
the whole picture?

877
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:53,885
The whole picture... it's Vought!

878
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:56,220
It's a fucking coup from the inside.

879
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:58,222
Wait, what are you talking about?

880
00:51:00,892 --> 00:51:03,352
Uh, ma'am, your nose.

881
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:08,126
Fuck!

882
00:51:08,127 --> 00:51:09,985
- Let's get the fuck out of here!
- Holy shit!

883
00:51:10,026 --> 00:51:14,530
- Holy shit!
- Come on! Get in! Go, go, go, go, go!

884
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:16,574
Must be a Supe out there.

885
00:51:16,616 --> 00:51:18,534
Are-are our heads gonna explode?

886
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:20,296
Frenchie, who do you
know who could do that?

887
00:51:20,328 --> 00:51:21,329
No one!

888
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:22,872
Are our heads gonna explode?!

889
00:51:22,914 --> 00:51:25,583
Look, I have a daughter.

890
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:29,170
I'm worried about Super Terrorists, too.

891
00:51:29,212 --> 00:51:31,130
But that does not mean

892
00:51:31,172 --> 00:51:34,258
that Vought can use
that fear to control us.

893
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,885
- Morning.
- Mr. Edgar, I'm sorry, I...

894
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,260
That's all right, Samantha.

895
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:38,596
Busy day.

896
00:51:38,638 --> 00:51:39,806
Morning, Homelander.

897
00:51:40,932 --> 00:51:42,475
To what do I owe the pleasure?

898
00:51:42,517 --> 00:51:44,477
Well, you never come up to 99.

899
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:46,854
So, figured I'd pay you a visit.

900
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:49,148
- What a lovely idea.
- Right?

901
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:51,234
After all, you run a superhero company,

902
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:54,278
and, uh, you never check
in with your superheroes,

903
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,364
do you?

904
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:58,741
Like, uh... oh, I don't know...

905
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:01,202
around the hiring of
that girl, for example.

906
00:52:01,244 --> 00:52:03,579
You wished to be
consulted on Stormfront?

907
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:05,581
Well, why not?

908
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:08,292
I signed off on all the rest.

909
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:09,961
I'm the leader of the Seven.

910
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:12,129
For which you have my undying respect.

911
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:14,298
See, I don't think I do.

912
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,008
No.

913
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:18,469
Not even Madelyn would've dared

914
00:52:18,511 --> 00:52:20,304
to try and pull this kind of shit.

915
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:23,432
Of course you know how important
you are to everyone at Vought.

916
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:25,893
No, no. Stan.

917
00:52:25,935 --> 00:52:28,855
I am Vought.

918
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:31,691
You show my photo to some
illiterate fucking camel jockey

919
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:34,092
in the middle of the Sahara,
he's gonna turn around and say,

920
00:52:34,093 --> 00:52:36,904
"Homelander", in perfect American.

921
00:52:36,946 --> 00:52:39,115
You know what?

922
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,993
My contract's up, end of this year.

923
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:49,500
Maybe it's time I, uh, move on.

924
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,503
How do you think your shareholders

925
00:52:52,545 --> 00:52:54,630
would feel about that?

926
00:53:06,976 --> 00:53:09,687
What do you know about Frederick Vought?

927
00:53:11,564 --> 00:53:13,566
Excuse me?

928
00:53:13,608 --> 00:53:15,151
Frederick.

929
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,485
Vought.

930
00:53:18,946 --> 00:53:22,700
Our esteemed founder.

931
00:53:22,742 --> 00:53:25,328
Well, I don't know, um,
not a lot, probably.

932
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:27,622
I only read his autobiography...

933
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:29,832
five times?

934
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:31,918
Not the self-serving bullshit

935
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:34,420
that we peddle to the
shareholders, the real story.

936
00:53:34,462 --> 00:53:37,882
- Enlighten me.
- Got his doctorate from Munich.

937
00:53:37,924 --> 00:53:39,884
Ahead of his time in genetics.

938
00:53:39,926 --> 00:53:43,679
Such the rising young star that in '39,

939
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:46,307
Hitler appointed him
chief physician at Dachau,

940
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:49,310
where he enjoyed a ready
supply of human subjects

941
00:53:49,352 --> 00:53:52,188
on which to test his earliest
iterations of Compound V.

942
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:56,484
For which we condemn in the
strongest of possible terms.

943
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:59,236
Early in '44, he felt the winds change,

944
00:53:59,278 --> 00:54:01,489
got spirited away to the Allies.

945
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,574
When Oppenheimer was
flailing with the bomb,

946
00:54:03,616 --> 00:54:07,411
Dr. Vought already had practical
applications of Compound V

947
00:54:07,453 --> 00:54:08,663
tested in the field.

948
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:11,207
Heroes like Soldier Boy,

949
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,876
killing Germans by the dozen.

950
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:17,088
So, Roosevelt pardoned him,

951
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:20,341
and he became as Wonder Bread American

952
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:22,885
as Disney and Edison.

953
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:25,388
Well, this is a truly fascinating,

954
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:29,016
if not slightly condescending
lecture, but, um...

955
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:31,352
I don't think I see the point, Stan.

956
00:54:31,394 --> 00:54:32,895
The point is...

957
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:35,523
that you are under a misconception

958
00:54:35,564 --> 00:54:37,233
that we are a superhero company.

959
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,651
We are not.

960
00:54:38,693 --> 00:54:41,529
What we are, really, is a
pharmaceutical company.

961
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:45,032
And you are not our most valuable asset.

962
00:54:45,074 --> 00:54:48,828
That would be our confidential
formula for Compound V.

963
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:50,413
Which you, man-child that you are,

964
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:53,249
released into the wild.

965
00:54:55,668 --> 00:54:57,503
Don't know what you're talking about.

966
00:54:57,545 --> 00:54:59,130
Well, let me remind you.

967
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:01,799
You slipped Compound V to
terrorists all over the globe

968
00:55:01,841 --> 00:55:04,468
to get you and your cronies
into national defense.

969
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:07,304
But maybe at the cost of
destroying the whole company.

970
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:12,018
I don't think I appreciate
your tone, sir.

971
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,811
Not much at all.

972
00:55:13,853 --> 00:55:18,149
And I don't appreciate that the
FDA now knows about Compound V,

973
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,693
or that it's only a matter of time

974
00:55:20,735 --> 00:55:22,361
before the public finds out.

975
00:55:22,403 --> 00:55:25,781
While you're preening
at the Golden Globes,

976
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:28,659
we're busy, running around like maniacs

977
00:55:28,701 --> 00:55:30,453
trying to clean up the mess you made.

978
00:55:33,205 --> 00:55:35,541
I don't have to consult you

979
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:38,753
about Stormfront or anything else.

980
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:42,006
Now...

981
00:55:42,048 --> 00:55:47,053
I believe you have a premiere
of Tek-Knight Lives to go to?

982
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:32,181
What are you doing here?

983
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:36,894
Well, I've come to see my son.

984
00:56:53,536 --> 00:56:55,246
Fuck, Hughie.

985
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:57,373
So glad you...

986
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,333
got us into this shit.

987
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:01,961
She had a husband.

988
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:03,629
Right?

989
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:07,925
A kid?

990
00:57:07,967 --> 00:57:09,760
Two... kids.

991
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:13,889
And I got her killed.

992
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:16,767
You didn't get her killed.

993
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:18,686
That wasn't meant for us.

994
00:57:18,727 --> 00:57:20,563
How do you know?

995
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:23,691
Because our brains aren't all
over the dash, that's how.

996
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:25,901
Someone was watching her.

997
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:27,278
And the minute she said something

998
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:29,864
she wasn't supposed to?

999
00:57:29,905 --> 00:57:32,658
Somebody from Vought?

1000
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:35,536
So, we're saying that

1001
00:57:35,578 --> 00:57:37,705
Vought may have just assassinated

1002
00:57:37,746 --> 00:57:41,041
the deputy director of the CIA.

1003
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:43,377
And now we're in the
middle of that, too.

1004
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:45,337
Happy now, motherfucker?

1005
00:57:57,725 --> 00:57:59,476
Hello?

1006
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:01,020
It's me.

1007
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:03,022
Jesus, you shouldn't be calling.

1008
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:04,857
I'm on a burner phone, it's fine.

1009
00:58:04,899 --> 00:58:06,692
Yeah, but somebody could be listening.

1010
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:08,652
Hughie, we did it.

1011
00:58:08,694 --> 00:58:11,697
He's getting me the Compound
V in, like, a day or two.

1012
00:58:11,739 --> 00:58:14,825
What do you think? Um... New York Times?

1013
00:58:14,867 --> 00:58:17,953
I mean, I was thinking
CNN or MSNBC, but...

1014
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:20,247
Okay, wait, wait,
just-just-just hold on a second.

1015
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:22,791
Come on, this is what
we've been waiting for.

1016
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:26,337
Let's burn those fuckers down.

1017
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:28,547
Just take a beat, let's figure out

1018
00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:30,174
- the best way to do this.
- Why?

1019
00:58:30,216 --> 00:58:32,009
- What happened?
- Nothing.

1020
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:33,844
Vought's just dangerous, that's all.

1021
00:58:33,886 --> 00:58:36,513
I mean, you got to be careful.
I don't want you getting hurt.

1022
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:38,182
I'm not gonna get...

1023
00:58:40,392 --> 00:58:42,978
If something happened,
you know you can trust me.

1024
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,980
We're in this together.

1025
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:47,900
No, I do trust you. It's just...

1026
00:58:47,942 --> 00:58:49,360
I just want to take our time.

1027
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:51,070
You know, do this right. That's all.

1028
00:58:53,239 --> 00:58:56,283
I know when you're not
telling me the truth, Hughie.

1029
00:58:56,325 --> 00:58:59,161
I kind of lived with
it every single day.

1030
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:04,375
Don't lie to me.

1031
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:06,335
Not again.

1032
00:59:12,258 --> 00:59:13,676
I'm not.

1033
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:17,304
Swear to God.

1034
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:25,187
Whatever. I, um...

1035
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:26,939
I got to go.

1036
00:59:55,384 --> 00:59:58,637
All right, easy does
it, lads. Easy does it.

1037
01:00:00,306 --> 01:00:02,683
Like I tried to tell this cunt...

1038
01:00:02,725 --> 01:00:04,059
I'm with that lot.

1039
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:05,644
Yeah.

1040
01:00:05,686 --> 01:00:07,980
What the fuck are you wearing?

1041
01:00:08,022 --> 01:00:11,483
That is a good question.

1042
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:13,110
You called him?

1043
01:00:13,152 --> 01:00:16,947
I'm sorry, Petit Hughie.
It's not a game now.

1044
01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:19,074
We need a real captain.

1045
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:22,494
Frenchie's right.

1046
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:24,747
This is a fucking mess, son.

1047
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:28,292
We got a Supe Terrorist,
Rayner's blown her canister,

1048
01:00:28,334 --> 01:00:30,961
and we're the most wanted
cunts in the country.

1049
01:00:33,005 --> 01:00:35,341
But don't you worry.

1050
01:00:37,009 --> 01:00:38,802
